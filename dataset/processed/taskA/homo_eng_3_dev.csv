Just look at these comments. I think 2 days before director naveen was speaking about women rights. There comments were like awesome or bold speech. Bt Just look at the comments here. All kinds of bad words. Very good guyz. Now women dont have rights to speak about women rights only. Bt men can speak and they will be applauded for it. superb guyz superb. All are commenting on her appearance. Why isnt her dress decent? She is wearing full sleeves shirt. She is nt even exposing her skin. Oh k Indian men want woman to be beautiful like saree and accessories. Bt they cant accept her beauty in mini exposing dresses. What u want guyz decide? U want woman to be decently dressed or traditionally dressed? U abuse decently dressed woman too. hypocrites.                        ,non-anti-LGBT,1

I think this is the first short film openly talking about LGBT community. I think most of the LGBT community people are very talented but they are abused by some people. they used to LGBT community people but after getting benefits threw them. after that's not breakup it's called betrayal of friendship. atleast they want some good words. but they treated LGBT community peoples are like ugly things. before getting favour they were never behaved like this. now all of u say who is wrong? either LGBT or that kind of cheated persons                        ,non-anti-LGBT,1

"They are genetically males. But due to lack of androgen receptors  excess androgen converted into oestrogen and will appear outside as females. And they will look taller, clear skin, with bigger breast. But female reproductive organs will be absent. Even the person who has this syndrome not aware of this. They will be usually supermodels. I m not sure there is rumour that hindhi actress radha who is Gemini daughter also has this syn. So next time if u see very beautiful girl pls be careful:)                        ",non-anti-LGBT,1

If someone is trying to convert some one gay, they cannot. Only if the other person is gay he will like it. If not he will reject. If its forced even after rejection from the other side its a criminal offence. Its sexual abuse whether its don't from a man to a women or from a women to a man or frm a man to another man or from a women to another women. It's still crime.

"Then you don't have options . And those women are not slaves . No one forces them to live like that. They love it , they feel secure and they find their own path most probably a right one. Go and ask your father that he ever buy a property in the name of your mother. We gave equal property rights to the women. We gave education . Do you know there are more than 70% of women are employed and equally paid . Yes they are covering their body for their safety. You forefathers looted your grannies treasures in the name of Dowry. In Suadi Arabia Dowry and Interest are prohibited . So don't call them slaves again.                        ",non-anti-LGBT,1
