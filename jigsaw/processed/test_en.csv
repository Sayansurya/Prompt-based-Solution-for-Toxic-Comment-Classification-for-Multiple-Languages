He has tried to stop every development on CDA since early Jan, even the ones that plugged huge holes - it's just more ammunition to him.  ::I did ask you for your thoughts above, I admit GoodDay, as you always say what you feel, which is great when you just need some straight advice. But I'm questioning myself now why I needed to take such a high risk. The risk of course is of you publically stating your opinion, then publically reversing it a bit later - effectively from offering support to my Canvassing proposal (which was nice of you, though not actually asked for) to supporting my work being sidelined and reverted by someone else to a simplistic 'per WP:Canvass' section """"if it helps CDA"""". The reply to your generosity was """"thank you GoodDay"""", of course, but what do you expect at that point? I've no idea if you changed your mind about Canvassing or not, but I doubt it - I suspect you still see it as a problematic issue, as no reasons were given to you (that I could see) to encourage you to significantly change your mind.  ::The risk of you doing this was so high, that I have to ask myself why did I ask for your advice on such a difficult and fraught issue (after you have already backed out once for a short while too)? The reason is that there is something fundamentally 'not right' with CDA. It's not just that it's been 'clamped' by a small group of editors. It's just not running as smoothly as something with the momentum it had at one point should. I think that's largely down to the thorny Canvassing matter, and the mayhem it could potentially cause Wikipedia - it must be on the back of most people's minds, and right at the front of those who voted in the Motion to Close. It's amazing that such a few editors have managed to effectively avoid dealing with something so central for so long. 'Per WP:CANVASSING' is the weakest 'cop out' i've seen on Wikipedia, WP:canvassing itself being so general and easily-abused.

"Laugh We've had another good laugh at your comedy turn. Regards to AA your dog I suppose and your other two fans. We all wait with baited breath to see if Commons to Lords comes up to our standards.

Regards from all in the Law department.ReviewBook of the Year Award 2010 NomineeFROM COMMONS TO LORD'S Volume 1 1700-1750 Ian Maun From a statistical and historical perspective one of the most important books of 2009 was the first volume of Ian Maun's series on eighteenth century cricket. In fact, after delving into this rich assemblage of material, published in association with both the MCC and the ACS, it is probably true to say that this is the most important book of the past few decades. This claim is based on the fact that the author, who works at Exeter University, has meticulously unearthed many new details as well as hitherto unknown matches from the early 1700s. This book draws heavily from newspapers, journals, letters and other documents housed in national and provincial collections, as well as other resources not generally available to, or used by, the majority of cricket historians, including history books, dictionaries, novels, plays and poems. Moreover, this is not a reworking of other writers contributions, as the author is not afraid to question previously published material or other works which have hitherto been accepted by historians as being chapter and verse on 18th century cricket. Indeed, this book includes more than 200 references to cricket which, until now, have never before been published whilst several errors and omissions have been carefully corrected and filled. One can only wonder at what further riches lie in the next three volumes of this series. The work stemmed several years ago from the author’s desire to understand the relationship of the Hambledon Club’s exploits to the cricket which had preceded those illustrious days. What started out as a series of notes trying to disentangle what was fact and what was fiction has metamorphosed into a work which provides a sharper and more complete picture of the noble game than previously achieved by many previous authors as well as some of the great scholars of cricket history.This period of tricorn hats, curved bats and two-stump wickets is vividly brought back to life by the year-by-year listing of references, supported by the accompanying notes and the series of beautifully reproduced images. As such, it is not a book which will be slavishly read time and again from cover to cover. Instead, it is a fantastic reference book with, as one would expect from someone with a strong academic background, a superb set of footnotes and bibliographical tools. Indeed, in his accompanying notes, the publisher claims that this book “will assuredly become the premier recourse for anybody interested in early and 18th century cricket history.” I would unhesitatingly venture one step further and suggest that in years to come, the author’s name will be spoken of in the same breath as Haygarth, Waghorn or Buckley. High praise indeed, but so richly deserved.review by Andrew Hignell",0

The answer is, because most would oppose it, but the anti-userbox admins think they know what is best, and are pulling every trick they can to cram this through.If you want to design either a jury-pool process or a general election process to decide such things, I'll be happy to help you.How is this a personal attack, except to note that the mass blanking happened and the perpetrator is documented?  Face it, the ban came only because what I said is unpopular with admins. MarkSweep made hundreds of blanking edits using admin tools, speciously twisted rules into knots and disrupted hundreds of users. He got a slap on the wrist, and polite applause.  I've received notes from admins on this page threatening me for suggesting that his actions constitute vandalism, which they clearly do.  I pass a note pointing this out to a small subset of the hundreds of users affected, I am banned for 31 hours.  How is this not political? Now I'm afraid to contact my own friends here, whom I know to be against this, but do not know about it.Tacky? Pretending this proposal is put before a representative audience is tacky, as is the slash-and-burn approach taken in the first place, as is the attempts by MarkSweep to fit me with a gag until the end of UPP (that is REALLY tacky), as is the naked political calculation on my AN/I as to how this speaks for their pet proposal, and how it should be played.  The fact is that this proposal will never have community assent because of its deep flaws, and I am resented for pointing this out.  Tacky is pretending in the face of all evidence that there is a basis for consensus here.",0

"Iranian CommandersLets Get something straight here; I will tell you who was really a commander on the Iranian Side. Ayatollah Khomeini- The Supreme leader controls the Army and the Pasdaran, so Khomeini is without a doubt a commander.Ayatollah Khamenei- The president maintains some control over the army and while he reports to the Supreme Leader, he still welds significant control over their day to day operations, therefore Khamenei is Also a CommanderMostafa Chamran- he was the Minister of Defense and a General under the Early stages of the war. He was killed in Action late in 1981. So he would have been sincerely a comander.Ali Sayad Shirazi- Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces during the War, no question about his classification as a Commander.Mohsen Rezaee- Commander of the Pasdaran, Heavily involved in the fighting, again, no question.Now here are people who should not be classified as commander. Abdolhassan Banisadr- President but He was impeached in the first days of the war, so he never commandered anything during the War.Mohammad Ali Rajai- President only for less than three weeks after Banisadr, so he never commandered anything. Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani- Throught his career as a cleric during the War, Rafsanjani never went into affairs regarding the military (exception being the Iran-Contra Affair) and simply worked with business within the country.Mir Hossein Mousavi- The Prime Minister did not wield any power over the military, he simply worked exclusively on affairs within the country.So please don't change the commanders list, this is all the proof you need.",0

I would have played it sometime in the years 1983-6; probably at the earlier end of that range.

It was a sort of first-person shooter game, with your (stationary) hunting blind at the bottom of the screen.  At varying intervals, a game animal would come trotting horizontally across the screenalmost like a phantom, you remember those early graphics?and you'd hit the fire button to release a cloud of very slow-moving buckshot.

The """"neutral point of view"""" is defined as the """"peer reviewed science"""" - which if you had read the climategate emails and followed this subject generally, you would know really means the view of a very political group of """"scientists"""" who have used wikipedia like a propaganda machine. Unfortunately, for you, the internet doesn't forget. It's already starting to happen on the climate, and no doubt within a few years I am quite sure there will be numerous instances, in numerous subject, where people are bringing out old articles from Wikipedia and highlighting the way they were POV in the extreme. I'm absolutely sure one of those areas will be the climate articles. And very soon as the """"consensus"""" on subjects change as real facts (and not opinions of people calling themselves """"scientists) come to light, the right wing press will have a field day highlighting the embarrassing way Wikipedia got it wrong in so many areas.The stupid thing is that people like me tried to bl**dy well warn you, and all we got is sarky remarks and warning not be """"warlike"""".

"""  == What a sham ==  I just read most of Conservapedias pages. About 5000 to be exact.  What a shameful website! Not only does it ban users who show liberal points of view, or points of view that do not agree with neo-con doctrine, but it also rejects some CONSERVATIVE points of view. Its basically an encyclopedia written only from Christian points of view, and Christianity is given a defacto statement of being true, while other religions are treated as suspect.  Also, on its page on Wikipedia, it states that Wikipedia founders once owned a pornsite. Hmmm, the purpose of that was... what? Most likely to show bias against Wikipedia. """"oooh looky here, they owned a pornsite, they must obviously be bad people!""""  Wikipedia will have articles that show up as biased, because anyone can edit them. There is no preference to who is right or wrong. all meet, discuss, and eventually settle.

"Personal dissapointmentThis article will never be a FA nor a good article. It also had been the victim of some wikipedia rules that don't apply to other articles on this encyclopedia. When I first started to edit on wiki I was quite enthusiastic but later this feeling faded. For example the artcle had been moved to a name that is not used in the world of football. Steaua had always been known for its official name: FC Steaua Bucureşti. This name is used worldwide to refer to Steaua. I personally found this situation annoying and I suggest that a move should take place. I mean, the other Romanian football clubs with Bucureşti in their naming were not moved and those awkward wikipedia rules applied only to this article. Here are some examples about football clubs that have articles based on their official club names: Sporting Clube de Portugal Associação Académica de Coimbra - O.A.F. F.C. Internazionale Milano Olympique Lyonnais Deportivo de La Coruña Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plataand the list can go on.If there is a rule on this issue let this rule be applied to all articles.

""" Third sentence of the lead Hello, I was just perusing this article randomly and I have a suggestion for the third sentence of the lead paragraph. It reads """"Anatomical similarities, geographical distribution of similar species and the fossil record indicate that all organisms are descended from a common ancestor through a long series of these divergent events, stretching back in a tree of life that has grown over the 3,500 million years of life on Earth."""" I have two comments on this sentence.1) First, it seems to me that the purpose of the sentence is to lay out, at the highest level, the independent lines of evidence in support of evolution. As such, I think that DNA (or genetic) similarities is a fourth line of independent evidence of the same level of importance as the three lines already listed in the sentence. Certainly, those three lines of evidence are the ones Darwin primarily relied upon when he laid out the theory (actually, he more apologized for the fossil record than relied upon it as an independent source of supporting evidence), but I think the incorporation of genetic evidence into the theory of evolution is at least as important a source of independent evidence and should be included in this sentence.2) Secondly, for both anatomical similarities and genetic similarities, it's not so much the similarities per se that are crucial, it's the pattern of those similarities. The article states later that it's the fact that these similarities can be classified into a hierarchy of nested groups that is key to their support of the theory of evolution. I understand the lead isn't supposed to go into all the detail that is laid out later in the article, but I still feel it's crucial to say something about how it's the nature of the similarities that's important.I might suggest: """"A nested hierarchy of anatomical and genetic similarities, geographical distribution of similar species and the fossil record indicate that all organisms are descended from a common ancestor through a long series of these divergent events, stretching back in a tree of life that has grown over the 3,500 million years of life on Earth."""" for that sentence.

"""  :I agree that my time has not been spent recently in the WickyWacky world, although I hoped that people would understand that professional responsibilities must sometimes trump what is essentially a """"hobby."""" I will continue to devote some time to the projects I had started but in re-establishing my watchlist, I noted with some sadness and resignation that a number of the articles that I had written had been """"rewritten"""" with a revision to an arcane and often singular style by a group of film editors. What is more disturbing is that numerous images have been summarily removed making them """"orphans"""" and thus causing the bots to go into effect. In checking the history of the removals, in nearly all cases, it was an editor on a """"crusade"""" whose intentions were always stated as being for the """"common good"""" but it did appear to be a distressing trend of cyber snobbery and bullying. My initial thought was to replace the images and edits as both actions went against the established """"first person's work remains"""" dictum but I started to pick up a pattern of these editors revising major articles to fit their own style, and further, then eliminating the original research and work that had already been in place. What is further evident is that the editors then triumphantly would boost their revised articles, putting them up for review and attracting further notice when other editors and coordinators recognized their efforts in a plethora of barnstars. I don't particularly mind that there is a sub-set of editors that are working in Wikipedia for personal gratification, the """"soliciting"""" of barnstars, placing their names into contention for administrators, asking for special privileges, ad nauseum... although that was never my intention in adding to the project. I am one of the editors who never has been after rewards and I do not wish to have my work necessarily """"peer reviewed"""" as the articles of themselves invite collaboration and should eventually become the work of many. What I noted on my recent return was the deliberate re-writing of a number of articles without a consensus for change, especially when the changes were in most part, stylistic. One of the galling aspects was the deliberate rewriting of citations and bibliographies that were painstakingly written in """"text"""" but did not follow the sometimes obscure """"templates"""" yet were perfectly acceptable examples of Harvard citations or other standard bibliographic formats. As a former librarian and now a professional editor and author, my work has revolved around the use of the so-called editorial standards or """"house style guides"""" to identify sources, so I believe I am fairly well versed on bibliographic methodology. Now when it comes to Wikipedia's style of referencing sources, the format chosen is an amalgam of two or three formats including the MLA (Modern Language Association), APA (American Psychological Association) and """"Chicago Style"""" guides. Rather than spitting in the wind, I have chosen to not try to re-write Wikipedia into my own notions and I tend to leave other people's work alone, however, that does not seem to be the case for other editors, as can be seen in the never-ending diatribe that is found in the format talk pages. So hopefully, this blathering helps explain my consternation at being labeled """"AWOL"""", as I was never far from the scene but had some genuine reservations about whether an effort in this medium was worth the trouble.

Headbomb himself admitted as much by correcting merely some of the illiteracies and incoherencies which I pointed out to him (while leaving most of the problems he introduced intact), of which corrections are totally unneeded if Headbomb would stop repeatedly introducing them. Headbomb's edits are purely destructive. He has added no information to the article; he has simply deleted information, and that while introducing illiteracies and incoherencies. He also has issued bizarrely false statements about his edits, such as stating that """"Tipler is not known for either the 'purported physical proof of God' nor any recognized quantum theory of gravity/TOE."""" Yet that's what the only two sections in the """"Academic work"""" section state that Prof. Tipler is known for claiming. Along with the deletion of the links to free book chapters (of which edits had previously been reverted by the Wikipedia administrator Irishguy), the pattern of Headbomb's edits show a clear intent to damage the article due to Headbomb's ideological dislike of Prof. Tipler and his work, of which is further reinforced by the personal information on Headbomb's user page. That is, Headbomb is attempting to get rid of information that would be helpful for others to learn more about Tipler and his work (such as the links to free book chapters; and the infobox """"Known for"""" field which, in the useful form in which I had it, would quickly let people know what Tipler is known for claiming: whereas listing books names and the Omega Point Theory's name would only make sense to someone if they already knew of them, and so they are either purely redundant or unhelpful; etc). Whereas I have an actual history of adding value to this article by writing most of the article's text, adding sections, and adding most of the references. I don't point out this fact as a claim of ownership over the articleunlike Headbomb, who has effectively argued to the effect that the supposed """"hard work"""" of his illiterate and destructive edits entitles him to keep the article the way he edited itbut rather to point out that I am actually literate and competent, and that I actually care about making it easier for people to learn about the subject of the article; unlike Headbomb's illiterate and incoherent edits, which get rid of highly useful information in order to make it harder for people to learn about the article's subject. The article was doing fine until Headbomb came along. He has acted purely as a troublemaker in regard to this article, due to his ideological dislike of the article's subject.

Whatever Orlady is asserting I have done, she has done more of towards me.I don't actually understand the standard SarekOfVulcan is applying with this block.  I don't understand a distinction that can be made about my edits, which would not apply more strongly for Orlady for example.  I have discussed Orlady's edits and she has discussed mine.  SarekOfVulcan seems to be applying some standard about """"discuss edits not editors"""", which is overall probably good guidance for wikipedia.  But, when I become aware of an editor repeatedly, i.e. hundreds of times, engaging in a behavior, and i describe that behavior as a pattern of edits, I do not think that is prohibited.  It is not helpful to prohibit that.Note, Orlady has refused mediation previously and has chosen not to answer repeated questions whether she would engage in mediation now.  Above she complains that I did not reply about a private email.  It is a worse offense not to reply to on-line request to engage in mediation.  I requested her to answer whether she would, three times, within this recent discussion and she has not answered. ncram """,0

His shortcomings must also be mentioned in addition to his feats like winning the noble prize. Do you think it'd fit better in political views? In anycase it must, and will, be mentioned somewhere. How about adding this in his political views segment: Peres' foreign policy outlook is markedly realist. For example, to placate Turkey, the only significant Muslim country in the region that is friendly towards Israel, Peres has explicity denied the Armenian genocide, which caused an uproar among genocide scholars.(citation)   Peres made these statements in 2001, when he was foreign minister. Clearly, he was caving in to Turkish pressure. Israel has very few friends and cannot afford to lose them, so basically it is not free to take the position that would seem to mesh with its outlook and history, which is to recognize that the Armenians were murdered en mass. Now he is president, an honorary position, not a political one, and his """"views,"""" whatever they may have been back then, are worth about as much as mine are.

I have the right create on my user page in a form of computer/new media art, to comment in whatever language or form I feel free to express in. I have done nothing to the above but request that he not mention my personal info. in his posts, but he insists on continuing this bullshit. I am not editing anonymously as there is no secret as to who I am. Yes, I attempted to expunge my earlier username and still prefer to, but this fucker keeps harassing me and insists on mentioning my name, project and username , all of which refer to personal and private info., and ultimately have turned to slander and libel, after repeated requests for him to stop.

I don't give a shit what a conservative little twat thinks of me or my work, my use or words, symbols and expressions. I have no issue over a few teenagers blacklisting one of my works of art from wikipedia. I do have an issue with the manner by which it was done, the red-neck good 'ol boy behavior of their klan, the hypocrisy of their actions and continued actions. There is no reason for you to delete my use of combined words and symbols, and no reason not to expunge as requested. btw...on the advice of buckets, see comments, I attempted to drop first username and logged in a new one, but these gays kept referring to and using earlier name...so I am responding to discussions that refer to both until this is resolved. As posted by buckets, this is the principle upon which my requests to expunge and remain anonymouys are supported.Wikipedia operates on the principle that every contributor has a right if they wish to remain completely anonymous. Wikipedia policy on that issue is strictly enforced. Posting private information about a user, specifically their (alleged) name and/or personal details, is strictly prohibited as harassment, and users who do that are often immediately blocked from editing Wikipedia.Such posting can cause offence or embarrassment to the victim of the posting, not least because it means that their name, and any personal criticism or allegations made against them can then appear on web searches.

""" Editing on Hypertension Hi DocJames, As a long time wikipedia watcher, I feel like I'm talking to a celebrity here after seeing your name on so many medical pages. I'm a medical student who uses wikipedia very frequently, and now that I'm getting to the end of my training I'd love to be able to contribute back to the encyclopedia that got me through my training. As you can see, I'm fairly new to the editing scene, so any guidance you can give me would be much appreciated. Regarding my recent edits on the Hypertension article, as I mentioned in the """"talk"""" page I'm basically trying to find a way to get rid of the """"daunting wall of text"""" problem that I feel the article has at the moment. I'd like to preserve all the hard work that others have done on providing detailed research, but to try to keep the page as something that even people who got diagnosed with hypertension and are wondering """"what's that?"""" can browse with relative ease. As such, I feel that the best way to go forward is to preserve the highly detailed content (most of which is only relevant to medical professionals) on specific pages, and keeping the sections of this page down to a few short paragraphs summarising the most relevant points. Let me know what you think about this approach, and please modify my submissions or revert them as you see fit.   """,0

"""  == Some new issues and information ==  I went on a bit of an editing spree, and while the list is in somewhat better shape, there are some lingering issues. I wasn't able to update the post/member counts on all of the forums as some did not clearly display it, and at least one forum was inaccessible (members-only access). Some of the forums that do not display a post count will still provide post counts for each subforum, I wrote some JavaScript to parse this for College Confidential and Wrong Planet, but I didn't have the time to modify it to work with any of the others (those two had formatted the post counts in a way that made regex matching much easier). Anyone wishing to update the post counts on those two in the future can just reuse the JavaScript, I left it inside a comment above both entries.  I also manually resorted the list from highest to lowest. BPDFamily.com had a massive drop in post count, from 12,550,839 to 2,946,601. I'm not sure why this happened, but the most likely possibility is that someone accidentally added a one at the front of the previous number, and nobody ever caught the error.  I added several major sites from the Curse network. While the ones I added do not have individual Wikipedia articles, they are all mentioned on the Curse Inc Wiki page I linked to. They should easily qualify for inclusion based on the number of posts/users, but may not """"perfectly"""" meet the inclusion criteria. I excluded the Bukkit (2.3m/408k) and GW2 Guru (2.1m/74k) forums because they were much lower volume forums and weren't really as significant, but was that actually justified?  There are some forums that might qualify but weren't added. Nexopia certainly qualifies, but I can't easily get a post count, and it's targeted at Canada instead of the US despite being English. HackForums is massive (46m posts, 2.7m members), but it's shady and there is no Wikipedia article (it got deleted in 2010 due to a lack of notability), so I'm not adding it, although I believe that the situation has changed significantly since 2010 and it would now be considered notable enough to justify a Wiki article and inclusion in this list. It's not clear why d2jsp, conceptart.org, Honda-Tech, etc are not considered worthy of inclusion based solely on requiring the article, but I'm not going to challenge that directly.  Anyways, here's the summary:  1. How should we handle updating the post counts on forums that no longer clearly display the current counts? While scripts may work for some forums, it is a bit impractical for others.  2. Does anyone have an alternate explanation for the BPDFamily.com drop? It's probably not important and just from an error when inputting the first value, but I want to make sure I didn't miss something major with a such a large (ten million!) drop in the number of posts.  3. Does anyone have any thoughts on the eligibility of the major Curse network sites that I added? Or on if my disqualification of the Bukkit and GW2 Guru forums was justified despite the sites technically meeting the criteria for inclusion?  4. Can someone (else) take a look at adding Nexopia and perhaps HackForums?  5. A very large number of these forums only have an article to link to because of sponsorship by a notable parent organization. While the parent organization may be perfectly notable, that does not always mean that the forum they run is actually really that notable. How many of these forums would actually justify their own Wikipedia page? I'm concerned that this makes notability a very poorly defined concept, and this list mostly worthless. Many of the """"clearly notable forums"""" (meaning standalone forums with their own Wikipedia page) have relatively sparse Wikipedia pages in the first place. There isn't much to write about with most forums, even extremely active ones. I'm being nitpicky, but I feel that the whole criteria for this list is a bit questionable, and that significance/notability would be better established by activity (using metrics such as post/member thresholds).

""", 15 November 2014 (UTC)From the Boston Globe:Lieberman, a Democrat who won reelection as an independent, also said he wants to be called an Independent Democrat.A strong backer of the Iraq war, Lieberman was returned to office on Election Day with strong GOP support. He ran as an independent after he lost the Democratic primary in August to Ned Lamont.He said yesterday on NBC's """"Meet the Press"""" that he will begin his new term as a Democrat because it would make him part of the congressional leadership. The senator is in line to become chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.""""I'm going to caucus with the Democrats both because it's good for my constituents in Connecticut, because I retained my seniority, I become a committee chair, but also I want to continue to work to bring the party back to its historic traditions of strength on national security, foreign policy, and innovation and progress in domestic policy,"""" Lieberman said.He said that because voters returned him to Capitol Hill as an independent, """"I am now an Independent Democrat  capital I, capital D. Matter of fact, the secretary of the Senate called my office and asked, 'How do you want to be identified,' and that's it. Independent Democrat,"""" the senator said.With many Senate Democrats having campaigned or raised money for Lamont, as the party's nominee, Lieberman acknowledged that it might be """"a little awkward"""" for him back in Washington.""""They played by the traditional partisan political playbook. And I can't say I enjoyed it, but we're all grown-ups, we've got a job to do, and I'm going to do my best to get that job done,"""" Lieberman said.Democrats will hold a 51-49 edge in the Senate, so Lieberman, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000, could find himself courted by Republicans.He was asked about the possibility that he might switch caucuses if he became uncomfortable as Democrats sought to enforce party discipline, particularly if the GOP offered to keep him as a committee chairman and respect his seniority.""""I'm not ruling it out, but I hope I don't get to that point. And, and I must say, and with all respect to the Republicans who supported me in Connecticut, nobody ever said, 'We're doing this because we, we want you to switch over,' """" he said.""""I believe that the American people are considering both major political parties to be in a kind of probation, because they're understandably angry that Washington is dominated too much by partisan political games, and not enough by problem-solving and patriotism, which means put the country and your state first,"""" Lieberman said.In 2001, Senator James Jeffords [Addition by Hodgdon's secret garden: (""""D."""")] of Vermont abandoned the GOP and aligned himself with the Democrats, putting them in control of the evenly divided Senate. The switch made him a hero among Democrats and a traitor among Republicans.Lieberman said Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia listed himself as an Independent Democrat in the late 1970s.

"""  ::::Your first quotation does not support either of the two disptuted statements (""""Canada has been a monarchy since 1534"""" and """"there have been 33 sovereigns of Canada""""). While I might dispute that the office of the monarch is the oldest continuous and unbroken institution in Canada—could not it be the Catholic Church?—the second quotation says nothing about 1534 or 33 sovereigns. All it says is that the Crownas an institution has existed in Canada since before 1867, a point not in dispute. Third quotation is not from a reliable source, which is a good thing, since it's baloney. The Canadian Crown has nothing in it of the old French crown and the claims made by the French which were transferred to the English in 1763 could just as well have been made and transferred by a republic as by the French monarchy. The 1583 date seems to contradict our assertion that 1497 is the important one.  ::::The statement that """"32 French and British kings and queens have reigned over Canada"""" is not the same as """"there have been 33 sovereigns of Canada"""". The term """"sovereign of"""" has different implications from """"reigned over"""". The Canadian Encyclopedia's statement is not objectionable. I don't think royal.gov.uk is a reliable source for reasons already stated, but its statement seems to trade on ambiguity—not to mention that it is in conflict with the dates of 1497 and 1583 for the start of British monarchical rule. The ambiguity is in the word """"monarchy"""", which could mean a type or system of government, or could mean a country with a monarch as its head of state. Canada (as this article understands it) was not such a country prior to 1867, but the French and British colonies (there were several) were always under a monarchical form of government (with the exception of Cromwell's time).  ::::""""There may have been two lines before 1763, but its evident neither of those two is considered apart from the present one."""" You can't consider them apart, because what is Canada now (and what was Canada in 1867) was divided between them in the 16th–18th centuries. It is silly to treat these monarchs, often at war with one another, as being a single monarchy, as this article does.   """,0

""", 21 April 2008 (UTC)Hey Merzul, glad you have a sense of humor too.  There is actually a policy that admins are supposed to follow when a block might be controversial.  Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject.  According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me.  He did not do that.  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do.  And """"Final warning"""" suggests a previous warning had been given.  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse.  Oh well, what are you gonna do.  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think).  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too.   I suspect the """"batman"""" comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman).  But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority.  But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy. To be clear, I'm seeing this as idiotically funny and not ranting against admins or Wikipedia.  Anyhow, here's to appreciating the occassional absurdity in life!  19:15""",1

"Oh dear Rick, we are back your misunderstanding of what probability means.  I am not sure if we are allowed to discus this any more, perhaps it is OK on this page.Richard confirms above that there are two interpretations of probability, Bayesian and frequentist.  Although they both should give the same answer to any exact question it is very confusing to flip interpretation in the middle of an argument.  I am happy to discuss the MHP using either model but let us start with the Bayesian perspective first.To a Bayesian, probability is a state of knowledge.  That is the definition of what Bayesian probability means.  In the Bayesian model, what is not known does not exist.  That is not something  that I have just made up, I am sure Richard will confirm it or you can confirm it using WP or any good text book.  So, if the player does not know where the car is placed, or the host's door opening strategy, the probability of winning by switching is exactly 2/3.  It may be that the car is always placed behind door 2 and the host always opens door 3 but, if we do not know that, it makes no difference to our (Bayesian) probability calculation, which depends by definition only on the information that we have, .  The concept of average probability makes no sense, there is just 'the probability' which is based only on our state of knowledge.",0

"""Alright. First to your analysis. Information darwinism is the opposition to pig-headedness. Bring me the right arguments and I will be convinced - as anyone should be. But failing to do so you cannot convince me. You cannot convince me by begging, threats, bullying, bribing and whatever else you can think of. Only the argument is what counts. What's """"right"""" is not defined by the mainstream opinion. If 2000 years ago, people largely figured slavery was the right thing, or that the earth was flat, or that violent computer games turn people into mass murderers, that doesn't make it anyhow right. The truth is not found by a demoscopic process, but instead, by an organic, darwinistic process that Information darwinism tries to understand and act in accordance with.I do consider your thoughts on the subject flawed on a deeper level. Part of our problem to communicate is certainly because of the limitations of language. When we use words, and you understand certain words to have a different meaning than how I understand them (e.g. """"Force"""") then we can not engage in a proper dialogue without first sorting out the terminology required. So if you do find that I use a word in a different way than how you would use it, or anything else """"weird"""", request from me a definition of the term. This is purely the linguistic barrier that must be overcome.Now to some items that I seem to have brushed over:The data suggest rape victims suffer more psychological trauma than other victims of assault. What data? By what standards? Someone beaten into a bloody pulp, robbed, or whatever, may well suffer more severe psychological trauma than someone who is victim to """"rape"""" by lax standards. These are problems rooted in terminology. If you want us to waste literally weeks to figure out the truthfulness of the statement """"rape victims are off worse than regular assault victims"""" then I have to say, no thanks. Because as a categorical statement, I can tell you right away - that is false.You claim to want rape treated simply as assault in one instance and then go and suggest it should be a special form of assault. (which it is)It is a (special) form of assault. That does not mean it needs to be treated with different standards than other, specicific (! better terminology?) forms of assault. Assault with a gardening rake is also a special form of assault, that doesn't mean it has to be treated fundamentally different from assault with a pitchfork. Again, terminology appears to be the problem.Having rape as a separate category of crime allows for special systems to be in place for victims and court systems.This is not something that I have """"brushed over"""". That is what you appear to be in favor of. I disagree strongly. If someone's victim of a criminal offense, he should not be treated """"specially"""" - that is, not like other victims of criminal offenses. Otherwise you are just asking for rape victims being ridiculed by society / police / legal system while non-sexual assault victims get treated fairly. I claim that only if there is no legal difference between sexual assault and non sexual assault, that sexual assault victims (and perpetrators) can be treated fairly as everyone would wish.Who do you actually propose giving these weapons to?How exactly is it my job to decide who should get weapons? I would assume, similiar standards to car ownership and gun ownership should be applied. Both cars and guns are extremely dangerous in the wrong hands - lethal weapons you might say - but both serve an useful purpose: Security and Transportation. I do not think that anyone should be denied the right to own a handgun. And I certainly do not credit a state institution with the rights to decide who gets to own one and who doesnt. But what exactly are you asking me for? Elaborate the legislature of my dreams? I don't see sense in asking me that.Well, there you have it. Basically all of the issues I have """"brushed over"""" in your mind come down to linguistic issues, terminology and the such. The answers are irrelevant as they can never be given without a ludicrous amount of detail given to the questions. I've known this - This is one of the underlying problems that you have - You fail to identify different uses of terminology and resolve them accordingly. But I would suspect that we have even deeper still disagreements on very many things than just the attitude of resolving conflicts of terminology. This is why I suspect your methodology of thinking is deeply flawed - rather than my own. And that is why I tried to tell you """"You first need to get your shit straight"""" before we can argue on actual subjects like rape legislature and social consequences thereof in a productive manner.I assume you will misunderstand many of the things I said in this post right",0

"""Hi. The issue here is very simple.  The article currently states there is """"NO"""" evidence that ECT causes brain damage in humans or animals.  The article also states that there are """"NO"""" recent reviews that found such evidence.  Both of these claims in the article have been proven to be grossly incorrect. Yet a paragraph is devoted to it.  Because such fallacious claims are made often however, a paragraph was written pointing out an example of a mouse study pointing to the contrary, and also cited a new study that found that ECT compromises normal cerbral blood flow in humans, possible evidence pointing to brain dysfunction.  The information is sound, supported, and appropriate given the subheading and the preceding paragraph that promotes gross misstatements of fact by saying that there is """"NO"""" evidence of brain damage in humans or animals, and """"NO"""" modern reviews pointing to such evidence. (And yes, there are reviews, as has been proven.)   The progression of arguments to the contrary here is quite odd and revealing:1) First the paragraph was too long and was trimmed down and a study removed.2) Then there's an argument that the two studies don't directly relate to one another and shouldn't therefore be in the same paragraph, even though it's abundantly obvious why they are (to contradict previous paragraph finding """"NO"""" evidence in humans or animals, and provide an example of study finding brain damage in mice, and an example study finding compromised, abnormal cerebral blood flow in humans)3) Then an argument that this mouse study should only be a minor footnote that no one will read (even though the reason it's there is to provide an example that yes, there IS evidence)4) Then an attack is made on the design of the study, apparently suggesting that it isn't evidence because of the mouse strain chosen. (which I disagree with, and regardless it's not a wiki editor's place to challenge the mouse strain choice of expert neuroscientists who make this stuff their life's work  it's their study. Moreover, it isn't the superiority of the study that got it here, it was listed as an """"example"""" that YES THERE IS EVIDENCE IN ANIMAL MODELS OF BRAIN DAMAGE).5) Then the claim is made that the mouse study struggles to support the paragraph.6) Then the mouse study is called trivial until it's replicated (even though again it was added as an """"example"""" that YES, there is evidence, not because of overriding importance)7) Then I pointed out in the talk page that one of the """"NO"""" evidence claims made in the preceding paragraph in the article is that there are no modern reviews finding evidence of brain damage. I proved this claim to be false, and cited to Peter Breggin, a very well-known MD who has written a book on the topic and a recent comprehensive review of the literature citing close to 200 references and finding numerous evidence of brain damage in animals.8) Then Breggin is personally attacked, apparently suggesting that his published review isn't good enough to disprove the """"no evidence in recent reviews"""" claim, because he's not a """"reliable source."""" (I also point out that there are other reviews finding evidence, including one done in the Russian mouse study).9) Then in response to me writing that there there either IS evidence of brain damage in animals or humans or there is not, and that a single study stating that brain damage was found in a modern study can defeat the harsh claim of """"NO"""" evidence of brain damage in animals, it's argued that """"that's not the way that science works"""", and """"several studies also can mean squat"""". 10) Then it's argued I can't negate """"secondary"""" sources that found no evidence of brain damage in animals or humans with direct """"primary"""" sources of published experimental studies which found such damage as part of their experiment. (This is not to mention that there are also other published reviews finding evidence of brain damage in others' work).11) etc.In addition to this, it's claimed that this single paragraph briefly showing a couple studies pointing to possible adverse effects (the subheading IS Adverse Effects, btw), violates the Wikipedia policy of undue weight.  This is incredibly strange as the paragraph immediately before the new paragraph is entirely devoted to multiple claims of """"No evidence"""" of braind damge in humans OR animals.  If a paragraph can be devoted to """"No evidence"""" stating untruths, then one can and should be added afterwards to give a couple of examples of this evidence which is claimed not to exist. Of course, the real problem here is the paragraph boldly asserting """"NO EVIDENCE"""" with regard to studies in humans OR animals of brain damage.  This has been proven to be false. The paragraph also asserts that """"NO"""" mo",0

"""  """"Donald Trump as an endorser of the company has previously been endorsed.""""  What?  Sorry, but this sentence doesn't parse.  Aside from that, you seem to be leaning towards the notion that an endorser of something must be unpaid.  Check Wiktionary, and you will see no implication that endorsement requires this.  It is a commonplace that if some celebrity endorses something, beaucoups bucks was spent to achieve this.  Is the news that Catherine Zeta-Jones endorses T-Mobile something that cannot be noted on Wikipedia because it is POV?  It is a fact that she did, and they paid her well  otherwise why the heck would she do it?  If I were to write in T-Mobile's WP article, however, that """"T-Mobile is such a great cell phone company that even the great actress Catherine Zeta-Jones likes it"""", that would be clearly POV, and she didn't say that, either, she simply read the ad copy they gave her.  By the same token, the news that Trump endorsed ACN is not POV, but a fact.  Presumably they paid him something, but maybe they didn't, there is no publicly available information on this that I am aware of, so saying he's a """"paid spokesman"""" is a speculation and violates WP:VERIFY  I do happen to know that there is a contract of some kind covering ACN's use of his image and so on, but that's not verifiable, so its not in the article.  I tend to think that Trump doesn't need celebrity endorsement contracts to support his lifestyle, but whatever.  As far as WP:VERIFY is concerned, the reference at the end of the paragraph attempted to cover the whole paragraph.  Do I need to add the reference to every sentence or assertion in the paragraph?  There is such a thing as over-referencing things, too. No, I think the paragraph should stay.    : Sorry, a typo.  This was a topic of discussion - see the talk page archive.  Calling him an endorser without revealing that his is paid can be misinterpreted. Being paid is akin to being a paid spokesman.  There is a completely different implication if one is paid to be on a commercial versus giving an endorsement without pay. —   """,0

"""There are still many fundamental problems with the string theory and its successors (M-theory etc.). I mention just three problems which a good Theory of Everything (TOE) should solve:1. A good TOE should be able to formulate its own principles and fundamental equations. Moreover, these principles and equations should clarify and simplify our picture of the physical world and allow some testable predictions. As far as I know, nothing like that is still available for the string theory (M-theory), in contrast to its rather long development and far-reaching claims. 2. A good TOE should allow  calculations of all interaction constants and particle parameters from its fundamental principles. It was actually one of the original Einstein's goals - to give some purely geometrical or mathematical origin to fundamental physical constants. No variant of string theory is able to calculate these parameters from some first principles.3. If the TOE is formulated in some space of higher dimension (11, etc.), as expected, there should be also a unique and justified principle of compactification - e.g., a principle how to project the structures from the 11-dim world to our tangible 4-dim world. In its contemporary status, (super)string theory is very fuzzy and umbiguous concerning the compactification. In my opinion, the very word """"theory"""" is rather premature in connection with the (super)string theory and Einstein himself probably would not be very happy with its present form and claims.

To include middle eastern as part of the Bulgarian genetic section is horrendous as it has nothing to do with the Bulgarian people. Mediterranean only partly. There are other evidence that states that Bulgaria has a stronger slavic influence like the Croats and the Slovenes, however there are some sources that claim they are separated from the tight slavic cluster together with the southern croats, serbs, macedonians and romanians. Both different sources should be respected but to include a middle eastern section is beyond belief, its a lie and totally ridiculous.

I see that you live in California, United States, which furthers my assumptions. There is more to the word """"state"""" than the """"US state"""" (e.g. Texas, Missouri, etc) definition; a sovereign state is a political entity that we call Canada, or Serbia, or Cambodia. With this definition, China, Philippines and Japan are """"states"""". The terms """"state"""", """"nation"""" and """"country"""" refer to concepts which may be similar, however still have their small distinctions. In order to avoid ambiguity, it's better to refer to objects such as China, Japan, Britain, Russia, the United States, France, et cetera as sovereign states, instead of the two alternative terms. A sovereign state is largely defined in modern contexts based on Westphalian sovereignty, whilst the definitions of nation and country differ depending on various contexts.I wouldn't put too much thought on what the Chinese Wikipedia says on this issue. The Chinese language, like all languages, has its limitations in that there is no one-to-one correspondence with English political vocabulary. The English words """"state"""", """"nation"""" and """"country"""" are all translated as """"國"""" in Chinese, as Chinese does not make such a distinction. The Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China is called """"中華民國國防部"""" (國 = nation), the United Nations is called """"聯合國"""" (國 = nation), the United States Department of State is called """"美國國務院"""" (國 = state), the Commonwealth of Independent States is called """"獨立國家聯合體"""" (國 = state),  and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is called """"石油輸出國組織"""" (國 = country).

I invite you to read it if, for nothing else, the strange sense of deja vu it will likely inspire in you, as it does in me. Cheers."""" This it the type of patronizing rhetoric I've received from what I consider at this point, outwardly Anti-Catholic editors in this site.  I know there is a good faith policy, sure, but the repeated disrespect and blatantly forward condescending attitude is just too obvious to conclude anything less.  I am aware you have supported the change of the article for the proper name """"Catholic Church"""" in the past.  I am determined to have our voice heard again and have this issue reviewed and hopefully repealed.  However, there is no way I can do this myself, I need you help and anyone else that may assist us.  (by the way where the due process ?)My most significant points for change are found in the one of my latest post as follows: """"1)Using a geographic description in addition to the title of a Church has to be one of the poorest excuses. What is not understood is that regardless of additional descriptive properties """"Catholic"""" Church IS the common title of the Petrine Church in the equivalent manner as """"Anglican"""" Church is the common title of the Church of England...regardless of any descriptive meanings of the words """"Catholic or Anglican"""". If anything it proves how inappropriate it is to impose an extrinsic adjective upon an institution that is not titled in such a manner. If that is allowed then where does it end. Why not add to the Greek the Athenian Orthodox Church, or say London Anglican Church since the symbolic head of the Anglican communion resides there.2)Since """"Catholic Church"""" is NOT a description, but the title of the lone Church titled as such, by far, historically, in the present and by the world at large it deserves to be title as such. It is not ambiguous, Anglicans do not say they are going to the Catholic Church, do they? Thus, no point in pulling out the ambiguity alibi Also, the article describes one Church, it is not a comparative study of several churches, no confusion to be entertained.3)The personal ignorance of a Catholic which refers to himself as Roman Catholic is not an excuse to go by such a term. Many of these same Catholics are the same ignorant Catholics that think Catholics of other rites are not real Catholics. Thus, ignorance is no reason, if any a reason for proper education.4)The listing of a Parish as Roman Catholic is reference to the Rite not the Church at large(albeit slang, where """"Roman"""" is interchanged for """"Latin"""") just as Byzantine Catholic churches are frequently listed as Greek Catholic Church. Since this article is discussing the Church at large and not the Rite, the usage within the church by the """"listing"""" excuse does not apply to this article.5)The Church in the few instances where it does add the descriptive adjective """"Roman"""" it is used in reference to its Petrine primacy and only when describing or comparing the Church with other schimatic churches.  This fact, is perfectly exemplified in Pope Pius XII's encylical Humani Generis where he mearly mentions """"Roman Catholic Church"""" as he speaks of churches not in  full communion. Because, in that entire encyclical Puis referrs to the Church as simply """"The Church"""" vs RCC 46 times to 1.6)Since, this article is NOT from within the Church there is no way to confirm that it is not mentioned pejoratively, thus the additional push to disregard this disrespectful term.  Face it, the only way to prove an article's description is not meant pejoratively is only if it comes from within the Church. (Wikipedia should not pretend that anti-Catholicism does not exist)Lastly,Wikipedia is not a Protestant or Anglican outlet. I mean really how many Protestants, Anglicans, or Orthodox refer to themselves as """"Catholic"""", yet that article is presented from the non-Catholic POV(as well as Catholicism). Yet, the Catholic is supposed to shut up and take it - fine, I'll take that for the terms """"Catholic and Catholicism"""". However, we are not allowed the common title of our Church in the name of outlandish excuses, instead the Catholic is supposed to swallow a term imposed by others outside the church, Anti-Catholicism, as is the preferred connotation of those against the Petrine Church.[9] [10] Where are the concessions coming from the non-Catholics?The injustice is truly preposterous!

Instead, it depicted itself as a citizens group merely interested in American ideals of freedom. Rather than argue the policy nuances of entitlement programs or new regulations, the Birch Society marshaled opposition by depicting progressive reform as capitulation to the Soviet Union. In that polarized environment, the interests of millionaires suddenly became aligned with patriotic families who wanted to do their part against the communist threat.Shortly after the Birch Society faded, David Koch founded Americans for Prosperity in 1984 (then known as Citizens for a Sound Economy)."""" author=Berkowitz, Bill | location=Oakland, CA}} """"He was introduced to conservative politics by his father, a member of the advisory council of the fiercely anti-communist John Birch Society .

So here is what I propose: zero article in the lead (and anywhere else where we are talking about the brand), but normal usage throughout the rest of the article, where appropriate. So """"The iPod is associated with one host computer,"""" would remain the same since it's talking about the product and not the brand.

Just like the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the NATO said they destroyed about 400 or 200 Armored Assault vehicles. But the truth is, that they destroyed only 22 or less vehicles. The Yugoslav had Volunteers from Russia, Greece, and I believe Yugoslav volunteers. NATO was involved, but had about six Aircraft (B-2 1, F-16 2, and AC-130 2), I believe the aircraft in the parenthesis are the ones that were used, but didn't inflict casualties, but for the F-16, I believe inflicted casualties 8.

"""Your inconsistent view points on references for cults and hate groupsIn talk:cult you say that the checklists must go because they are unscientific, though they are clearly mentioned as disputed and attributed to the anti-cult movement. The one by Lifton is referenced. I support replacement of the other checklist by the one by Eileen Barker.  12:45, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)In talk:hate group you support a checklist presented as proven fact that is unattributed, but just made up and you oppose my view that the checklist must be referenced.  12:45, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)I may miss something but it seems that you use double standards to support your views. I hope that your can re-consider your opinions about references for checklists on these subjects. Thanks in advance.  12:39, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)Good point, Andries. I do not have a problem with these checklists if they are placed in the destructive cults article.  19:07, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)Zappaz, thanks for you changing your opinion. The problem is, I think, that it is difficult to distinguish between a harmless NRM, a cult and a destructive cult. That is why I think the checklists are important and should stay in the cult article, or at least directly linked to. I mean, my former group has some destructive/exploiting traits, which I only found out after nine years. Besides many scholars, the media and the public do not make the distinction between a cult and a destructive cult.  19:19, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)That is exactly the reason: the media and the public do not make that distinction. My hope is that the Wikipedia articles can throw some neutral light into that confusion. That is my hope. With your help and the help of other editors editing those articles, we have a good chance to suceed in doing that.

In fact, I defended you against Jim's accusations.  23:06, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)I checked what I wrote on forum8 about you the last 60 days and I could only find the following post by me in which I defended you. http://www.forum8.org/forum8/posts/7621.html  23:06, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)I really do not understand why you think that my behavior towards you is inappropriate.  23:06, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)Zappaz, I think we have to concentrate on articles to prevent endless and senseless discussions.

"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.  ==""",1

"Wow! My thought experiment has gotten you all fired up, it seems. -) In the case of the Trouton-Noble experiment, all the interactions involved are electromagnetic interactions. So once a theoretician has granted that in the physics of electromagnetism the Lorentz transformations apply, things can be taken from there.Now, of course, Lorentz had to assume that a planet that is moving through the lorentzian ether is flattened in the direction of motion, just as everything else. That is a modification of how the force of gravity is transmitted. Coulomb force couples to electric charge, what does gravity couple to?  But does the force of gravity couple to the rest mass, or to the total mass? If gravity couples only to the rest mass then the ether theory stands a chance of reproducing the prediction of the Einstein interpretation, as the rest mass is invariant under Lorentz transformation. But as far as we know gravitation involves the total mass. This is an illustration of the fact that in relativistic physics gravitation just bursts out of the confines of special relativity. Something has to give. This theme is similar, I think, to the theme in John Nortons paper about Nordström's Lorentz invariant scalar theory of gravitation; gravitation just bursts out of special relativity, and a successor to special relativity is needed. (And was provided by Einstein.) Poincaré's 1905 Palermo paper (facsimile reproduction, non-digital, 3 MB file) has a considerable section about gravitation. I'm not sure, but I don't think that Poincaré demands gravitational-inertial mass equivalence as a constraint on the theory. I think that if Poincaré had anticipated that light is deflected by gravitation, he would have written so. I think it was well after 1905 that recognition came that light does not only carry momentum, it also carries inertial mass. When light propagates from an emitter to a receiver, it not only transmits momentum, it also transmits inertial mass. The inertial mass of the emitter decreases on emission of the light, and the inertial mass of the receiver increases on absorption. Of course, light has zero rest mass. Since light has zero rest mass, the natural assumption is that light is not affected by gravity. Possibly, considerations of this nature made Poincaré very, very cautious towards attributing inertial mass to energy. In his 1909 Göttingen lecture, Poincaré went very far in attributing the increased inertia of a fast-moving electron to increased energy of the ether surrounding the electron, in response to the high velocity of the electrons. Can that still work for muons and tauon's? My understanding is that electrons and muons are identical as far as electric charge and spin are concerned, but that they are different in rest mass. Should electrons and muons become more and more alike at higher velocities? To my knowledge: at all velocities the energy of muons is the muon's rest mass multiplied with the relativistic factor.I am indeed very curious how Lorentz dealt with these issues. As you indicate: historians of science describe that Lorentz retained a preference for using a lorentzian interpretation, but from the lectures Lorentz gave in the 1920ties it can be seen that Lorentz had full mathematical mastery of special and general relativity.  | Talk",0

""" Fixing the article I’ll propose below, for comment, a couple of alternative ways to proceed to fix No Gun Ri Massacre. But first ….The recent interest shown by ,  and, now,  presents a real opportunity to improve the article and bring it back to high WP standards. In the past couple of years, new sources have been published and there have been new developments, including a more settled estimate of the dead from South Korean authorities. They belong in the article.But it will be a demanding task; there’s a hell of a lot wrong here. And, most of all, to fall back on a cliché, it’s essential not to lose sight of the forest for the trees. One big “forest,” clearly, is the way-out-of-line behavior of WeldNeck, not just at No Gun Ri Massacre, but Wikipedia-wide, as evidenced by the repeated warnings from other contributors, including many he simply deleted from his Talk page, as with ’s edit-warring warning at [], and including ’s observation [] that he has engaged in “POV pushing on all the articles you have edited.” As said, one must go back in his Talk history to find the thousands of illicitly deleted bytes. Then recall his outrageous action of just two days ago, killing my posting here at NGR Talk, and his taunting “have fun with this” when he posted his frivolous bid for a topic ban at ANI. When you combine all this with his dozens and dozens of rapid-fire, unjustified, unexplained reverts at No Gun Ri Massacre, I think it should be clear this is a guy who cannot be trusted on anything.The “trees,” the distractions, are the red herrings that WeldNeck and other denialists wave on No Gun Ri. (Before WeldNeck, there was an NGR denialist going by """"Kauffner"""" who got banned for general mayhem around WP.) The denialists arose in the year 2000, grasping at anything to attack those whose research work exposed No Gun Ri and thereby made the U.S. Army look less than saintly. One of their problems, along with their blinding anger and their obtuseness about so many things, is that they’re stuck in the year 2000. Since then, after long investigations, the South Korean and U.S. governments confirmed that the U.S. military killed the trapped refugees at NGR “by the effects of small-arms fire, artillery and mortar fire, and strafing”; it emerged that more than a dozen military documents showing orders to shoot civilians were suppressed in the U.S. investigation; a Harvard historian reported (in 2005) the discovery of a U.S. ambassadorial letter to the State Department warning, on the day the NGR killings began, that the Army had decided to shoot approaching South Korean refugees (another suppressed document); other media organizations, including the BBC, replicated and then advanced the NGR story beyond the original reporting; a government committee led by South Korea’s prime minister certified a minimal death toll, with identified victims; and the government built a large memorial park and museum at the site where the facts of NGR are enshrined in exhibits and informational material, and where a new, consensus death toll is accepted. This is the “forest” to keep in mind.Other knowledgeable journalists and academics have looked to me to maintain integrity on this subject in WP and elsewhere, as a retiree with more time available to learn WP's basics and monitor things. But they and I literally haven’t had the stomach even to read the article for many months, so disgusted were we at the way one out-of-control guy was allowed to run roughshod over the truth, not to mention turn it at times into a semi-literate, illogical mess. I’ll swallow hard and read it now.A couple of possible ways to deal with this problem:TimothyJosephWood, admirably, was willing to dig right in yesterday. He started from the top of my “litany” of WeldNeck’s unjustified reverts (a list done months ago but never posted until two days ago), and it turned out that first revert, a minor matter, had been remedied since I first noted it. A possible solution: I’ll compare my two lengthy lists of problems (from late 2013 and late 2014) and update them into one that lists problems that still exist. And Mr. Wood or others could then work from that. That might take me one day to prepare.Alternatively, I myself could begin making edits, and other interested parties could stand by and observe the reaction (and ask for better explanations from me or whatever). In that case, I might as well also assemble some of the new material and sourcing I refer to (to include new external links etc.). That might take me u",0

""":Thanks again JA.  In the Ockham's razor article, we have: The origins of what has come to be known as Occam's razor are traceable to the works of earlier philosophers such as John Duns Scotus (1265–1308), Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225–1274), and even Aristotle (384–322 BC) (Charlesworth 1956). The term """"Occam's razor"""" first appeared in 1852 in the works of Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805–1865), long after Ockham's death circa 1349. Ockham did not invent the razor, so its association with him may be due to the frequency and effectiveness with which he used it (Ariew 1976). And though he stated the principle in various ways, the most popular version was written not by himself but by John Ponce of Cork in 1639 (Thorburn 1918).""""I count 3 (three) external references, and no """"unfortunately.""""

"You are talking nonsense again. The reconstructed pronunciation is not a modern theory nor has it been substantiated by modern linguists. Repeating the same old 19th century out of date fallacies in a modern book does not constitute evidence or substantiation. The only differnece between modern linguists repitition of these fallacies and the original is that the modern linguists have removed all of the racist slurs from the original work (well most of them anyway) and have included the disclaimer that none of the nonsense they are regurgitating is provable given the historical evidence, or rather the complete lack of it, and modern research which is unanimously against the theory. Thanos Papadimitrakopulos publication is a perfectly valid source since it postdates the standard form of the reconstructed pronunciation that is still taught today (a theory that is never substantiated to students but is taught as unproven dogma) and he has never been refuted. Chrys C. Caragounis is a linguistics expert and a philologist and is thus a valid source. Development of Greek and the New Testament, Mohr Siebeck (ISBN 3161482905) is his most recent publication a probable the most recent research on ancient Greek pronunciation in existence. Anyone claiming to be an expert in ancient Greek that still believes in the reconstructed pronunciation has no right to be called an expert since it is like believing in the Ptolemaic Earth centred universe which observations have shown to be wrong. All of the experts in Semitic linguistics are against the reconstructed pronunciation of ancient Greek since they make it perfectly clear that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek at the time the Septuagint was translated from the original Hebrew in 280 BC. This therefore implies that classical Greek must have been pronounced like modern Greek as well otherwise 72 Hebrew expert who were taught ancient Greek as children 50 years earlier would not have associated the proto-Semitic fricative gimel in Gomorra which was no longer used in the written language but was only spoken as a breath with the Greek letter gamma. Gamma therefore must have been fricative and there a myriads of other examples that Semitic linguists use to show that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek and that the Hebrew alphabet represented the mediae and dasea and z as fricatives. It is clear from the study of Semitic linguistics and from experts in the filed like Caragounis and Papadimitrakopulos that the reconstructed pronunciation is a racist sham based on Germanic supremacy (as can be seen from the slurs in the papers of is original creators) and an affront to science and the only reason why it is still being tangut is for ethnocentric reasons alone.",1
""" Members/Former Members I'm confused as to how you can list Syd Barrett and Bob Klose as """"former members"""" and not Roger Waters or Richard Wright (who is dead, in case anyone forgot  hard to be a member of a band when you are dead). Isn't there a better way to do this, such as listing everyone as members with dates active like at the bottom of the article? Or, could we just re-name the """"members"""" section to something like """"classic line-up"""", and the """"former members"""" to """"other members""""? And, to anyone who wants to claim that Roger Waters is a current member because he played a one-off show with David, Richard and Nick, I would be curious to hear what Gilmour (the current band leader, if there is a current Pink Floyd to speak of) thinks about that.

I still don't agree with some of the edits you have made, i.e. """"acoustic instruments"""", as they seem intent on minimizing Ms. Amos' strengths as a musician.  It's one thing being neutral about a subject and it's another thing minimizing the point of it being a """"subject"""" to begin with.  Ms. Amos was not approached by Deutsche Grammophon because she """"plays the piano"""", but because she plays it with skill.

":There ia also a cultural element to ethnicity that needs to be addressed, but much of this discussion seems to be people just expressing opinions with no real debate. I don't understand the claim that English culture is Germanic and somehow different to Welsh and Scottish culture, I also do not see any great similarities between Scottish and Welsh culture, except for those that they also share with the English. I think it would be better to discuss the sources of peoples POVs and try to come to a consensus on how to incorporate all points  of view. There is  clearly a POV that somehow English people are ethnically Germanic and distinct from the rest of the people of Great Britain, I personally find this difficult to believe. Even if one does subscribe to this POV then one has to accept that British/English people have shared the same Island for over a millenium and a half, and the claim that some sort of ethnic apartheid occured during these centuries doesn't strike me as very believable. Nevertheless I am prepared to accept that this is a valid POV, contingent on properly verified sources. There is also the question of Scots, which is also a Teutonic language, so should we consider the speakers of Scots Germanic as well? If one accepts that the English are the descendants of the indigenous British inhabitants of Great Britain (which they are) and also of some immigrating people (who possibly but not certainly constituted an invading force), that the observed cultural changed introduced by the Anglo-Saxons may just have equally been introduced by cultural diffusion over several centuries (and no one disputes that there was some migration, but Danes settled in the Danelaw at the end of the nineth century, and there certainly doesn't seem to have been any great displacement of indigenous people) and that the English language is not necessarily an indication of mass migration or a rapid cultural change, then it is also a reasonable point of view that the indigenous culture changed over time (as it had in previous times). Most archaeologists now point to greater continuity rather than any rapid change. From a linguistic point of view Welsh serves as a good example here, at the start of the 20th century the vast majority of people spoke Welsh as a first language in Wales, indeed immigrating English people who came to work in the heavy industries of South Wales in the nineteenth century had to learn Welsh. By the 1940s Welsh was a minority language. In A History of Wales John Davies argues that the Welsh gave up speaking Welsh voluntarily. He reasons that the internationalist nature of Socialism (strong in Wales) and the progressive nature of Non-conformists led to a consensus that language could be a barrier. He also argues that there is no evidence that coercive measures like the Welsh not had any significant impact. No one is arguing that there was a mass migration in Wales at the beggining of the 20th century, nor is anyone arguing that Welsh people gave up their identity or culture, they just stopped speaking Welsh.",0

Additionally, if he is not a high profile expert on terrorism, I think the single mention at the Srebrenica Massacre entry is sufficient.  Name one influential book or paper DT has authored?  If not I believe there is a total lack of objectivity at work here.  DT has pointed out that this campaign coincides with vicious attack blogs by the pseudonym Johnstone and others.  At worst he is a compiler, a government employee of the BiH government, certainly not a war criminal.  Also while Srebrenica massacre may be a well known event, DT played no role at all in it, and the hyperbole """"single most notable massacre in modern European history"""" is way off base, I think Srbrenica can be compared to Croat ethnic cleansing in Krajina and Croat atrocities against Muslims in Mostar, in fact it is similar to murder of Greeks in Cyprus and falls way short of deaths of civilians in Chechnya. Soi why so eager to hang the Srebrenica Massacre on someone who wasn't there and is not a world renowned expert on terrorism.  Do I sense a personal agenda by ChrisO and others.

It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with.Brazil 1–7 Germany was the shock result of the first semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup men's international football tournament, played on 8 July at the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay.  """,0

The current article contains a section called """"criticisms and questions regarding effectiveness"""" in which a few random studies have been cited, and a laundry list of random arguments are put forward. It is not a comprehensive precis of the effectiveness literature. The article neglects a wide body of work that points to a) the success of some types of therapy with specific types of disorders, b) discipline-agnostic characteristics of therapist behaviour that contribute to success, c) superiority of psychopharmacology & psychotherapy combined, vs either intervention on it's own, d) characteristics of clients/patients that seem to benefit most from psychotherapy, and e) vested interests of stakeholders in swinging research to one side of the debate or the other and other inhibiting factors - consider the two APA's, the various laws and licensing authorities, the separate academic communities in psychiatry, philosophy, social work, occupational therapy, the professional jealousies, the profound neglect of mental illness and psychological wellbeing in public health and health insurance, and the impact of the pharmaceutical industry's deep pockets on the dominant discourse.  Please note that I am editing anonymously in protest against the tyrrany of the editing majority. Wikipedia's non-negotiable, amateur editor norm might be appropriate for certain article categories, but in more nuanced technical spaces there is invariably a segment that make nuisances of themselves by wanting to debate every word and angle. I have watched the development of articles on schools of psychotherapy since the early 2000s, and I'm afraid time and multiple amateur edits have not improved them much. In the specific case of psychology their mistakes add to the perception that this is a wishy washy discipline void of a body of knowledge and ANY facts.

""":::This smells like Chris Lyons is phoning in another one of his canned cut-and-paste objections to an addition to this article, full of unsubstantiated babbling about """"NPOV"""" and """"NOR"""" and """"coatracking."""" Here is the quite well documented facts about how Proposition 8 is described: The way its proponents describe it. Since this for them is largely a matter of posturing and semantics - because their own people are completely unaffected by the results of the measure - their interest in the subject pretty much ends with the passage of the measure. They can say marriage is only """"x"""" because their own people are prohibited from ever expressing something other than """"x,"""" the demonstrated behavior of Ted Haggard and many if not most of their own people notwithstanding. It for them is largely a demonstration of power and status, of ostensibly being able to call the shots by social and political means, by calling for purification of society as they in their fantasies imagine it should be, no matter whose bodies happen to be in the way. (Gives a whole new meaning to the Pentecostal chant/song about """"under my feet."""")The way the people who will have to deal with the aftermath of the measure's passage describe it. Since the Attorney General has to enforce the law once passed, the Attorney General titled the measure so that what happens after the election is quite clear: certain people's rights that existed before the election were eliminated. Since the people proposing the measure aren't ever going to be in that class, or so they believe, they don't care about this, or even care enough to allow the suggestion to pass  that the lives of people will be affected. That goes for editors here who are proponents of the measure, who are fighting against any measure of Proposition 8 in a way that might actually hint that individual people are going to be affected by having their rights eliminated. (Yeah, they don't care about people outside their churches except as potential converts, as notches on their bedposts, to be manipulated at will, against their consent, unless and until they get their butt in church. They call this """"love,"""" of course, in case you were wondering what they think that word means.)Describing it both ways, which would be the equitable way of dealing with the situation as documented.Describing it in neither way, simply linking Proposition 8 to the article about it.After two months of having to restore the ballot title """"eliminates the right of same-sex couples to marry"""" to the Proposition 8 article in the runup to the election, and having sat through one of the satellite simulcasts promoting the measure, clearly this is how its proponents think. They seem to live in a people-free universe, that nobody will be affected by it, and demand that any description of the measure that actually mentions people's rights must be scrubbed. That is what certain editors want to continue doing here. Justifying this scrubbing and elimination of the mention of real-world consequences of the measure is not """"NPOV."""" It's attempted scrubbing of dissenting views, to which I object in the strongest possible terms. As for COI, your insinuation that anyone objecting to Prop 8 here is a directly-affected, by the common standards of the proponents' evangelical community, dirty diseased queer whose edits must be blocked or questioned on the basis of a COI just shows exactly where your prejudices lie.
