"""  ==Are you alright? )==  Hi,  You've asked a question I never thought would arise, and it makes me worry for your sake a little  Wikipedia might be getting to you! ;)  The name had no meaning or signification for me at all when I concocted it (whilst intoxicated no less!)  Originally, I pronounced it  """"ZOH"""" (as in Zodiac) - loz (as in the Wizard of Oz.)  A friend later suggested that another possibility.  Take a music (or a Han) """"Solo"""", pluralize it: Soloes, and change the intial sound to a Z.  ZOH-lows, I guess I'd write that.  I am a rather odd fellow, as is well-known, so this is what I decided.  The first use of Xoloz by me was NOT on Wikipedia, but elsewhere.  To distinguish between this other use and my Wikipedian name, I use the """"original"""" pronunciation (The Wizard of...) for non-Wikipedian purposes, and the more recent suggestion when referring to the Wikipedian.  Aren't you glad you asked? ;)  My answer gives further insight into the depths of my insanity; I am proud of myself, though (and pleasantly surprised), that I managed to keep my explanation of the name this short.

"So you find that a right-wing and left wing unreliable source agree and assume they must both be correct.  There has been considerable study of Marx and there is no reason that we need to use popular books as sources.  The only reason one would use them is that they contain claims that have not been accepted by mainstream historians.  Also, they lead us into discussions about what really happened which is a misuse of other editors' time.  We have an unsubstantiated claim by Jenny Marx made years after the event that her husband provided money for workers to buy weapons.  We do not by the way have any reliable sources that these workers obtained or used weapons in Belgium in 1848.  Reliable sources state that the French government supplied unemployed Belgian workers with weapons in Paris and these workers then returned to Belgium in an attempt to overthrow the government.  We know that Marx was arrested on suspicion of carrying arms and was ejected from the country, but in fact the accusation was false.  The types of additional sources that Martintg has provided are unreliable.  Boris Nicolaevsky for example was a communist activist (writing in 1933), not a mainstream historian.  Wheen and Muravchick are neoconservatives writing outside the academic mainstream.  We just do not know what Marx did with the 6,000 francs he received.",0

"== French overtures to Japan, 1883-5 ==  Hi ,  Thanks for that interesting stuff you have dug out on French attempts to cosy up to Japan against China before and during the Sino-French War.  I'm going to search Albert Billot's L'affaire du Tonkin, the standard French diplomatic history of the Sino-French War, to see if he can add anything to your research.  What I would like to do eventually is merge your new section into the existing section 'China's fear of Japan', and probably cut it down a bit.  At the end of the day, France and Japan did not become allies, and I think it unbalances the main article to devote so much space to something that never happened.  On the other hand, I've long been wanting to create a new article, Diplomacy of the Sino-French War, and that would be the natural home for a discussion of French overtures to Japan.  I'll try to get round to it before long.  I'll get back to you after I've seen what Billot has to say on the subject.      P.S.  Nice photo you uploaded of French soldiers in Tonkin in 1888.

Just before making that analogy I wrote:   """"5. TWO CASES TO THINK ABOUT. - ... please don't say """"Oh, but that's different..."""" ...""""   The first """"airship"""" example was intended to make clear that a Lift force can be created in a fluid by pressure forces alone, so -dP/dt is NOT absolutely essential. The second """"wave"""" example hinted at how dynamic effects can create such Lifting pressure zones.  ~o0o~  2.  """"Only part of the overall flow pattern supports the aerofoil ... in that part that actually supports the wing, the air is being deflected downwards. [etc...]""""   That whole paragraph is wrong, or at the least, very misleading. All parts of the flow pattern depend on all other parts of the flow pattern. That is why it is called """"Continuum Mechanics"""".  Any smallish volume of fluid near the aerofoil (ie. any fluid that might be said to """"actually support the wing""""), necessarily has very small mass. There is simply NO WAY that this small mass can cause ALL of the Lift via its -dP/dt.  Instead, this small volume of fluid is responsible for a VERY SMALL part of the Lift, via its downward dP/dt. The rest of the Lift comes from the PRESSURE FIELD surrounding this small volume. That pressure field (established when the aerofoil first started to move, or accelerated) is also related to the momentum changes of all the other parts of the fluid, more than half of which are now UPWARD dP/dts.   ~o0o~  3.  """"Thus, in practice, the application of dp/dt is quite complex ... So the true debate here should [be, how do we give] a simple introduction to the Newtonian model of dynamic lift ... introducing the basic principle ... to the relevant localised airflow...""""   What you are suggesting is that this article should teach a FALLACIOUS model of Lift, for purely IDEALOGICAL reasons. (This shouting is just to make this point clear, so I don't have to repeat it.)  Specifically, your qualitative """"Newtonian Model"""" is incapable of giving any quantitative results. To get any results at all, you must first know the Lift, then ARBITRARILY assume an amount of mass to do the Lifting (ie. your """"relevant localised airflow""""), after which you get an """"average"""" acceleration value, but NO IDEA of what the actual flow field looks like.  This is an utterly useless approach to understanding FDL (ie. it is of zero help in designing aerofoils), that is taken simply to support an idealogical viewpoint (ie. that """"Lift MUST be due to Downwash...""""), with that viewpoint being WRONG anyway (ie. as many others here now agree, there is NO NET change of vertical momentum).

'  To which we might have to add, """"... and, because Newton said so, all FD-Lift is due to Downwash"""". And maybe after that ETT can make a comeback.  ~o0o~  4.  """"Besides seeking refutations of Clancy's position, I emphasised the importance of relevant citations. I had hoped for verifiable quotations clearly relevant to Newtonian flow deflection and explicitly countering Clancy's position, yet the silence on this point is becoming deafening. No relevant citations, no progress.""""   Again, your deafness seems decidedly idealogical in nature.  As already quoted and cited many times, the major part of Lanchester's book is directed at refuting """"Newtonian flow deflection"""". All of the """"Circulation/Vortex Theory of Lift"""", hugely successful for 100+ years, and which has countless citations from umpteen reliable sources, refutes it.  If anyone is seriously interested in this Article, then they should study this body of knowledge more deeply before trying to impose a false idealogy upon the next generation.

"""You are repeating the behavior this discussion page has seen in the past 24-48, censoring, maligning and mischaracterizing persons due to political and religious POVs of yourself. Duh, that's what happens in Discussion pages about religious denominations and political candidacies. Your action and your comments here are almost astute, but not quite: The article about Temple Lot was created by a member of the Temple Lot faction, Jared Smith, and and has been constructively edited by his older brother Jordan Smith, who is also an active member of the Temple Lot faction. Not a """"former member"""" or an """"excommunicated"""" member, but a full baptised member, """"in good standing"""" according to the bylaws and official documentation both within and outside the faction. Due mainly to the machinations and malice of an anonymous editor, Good Ol'factory (whom you know perfectly well is the same as the Snocrates/Zoporific who began unconstructively editing the Temple Lot articles in December 2007), both Temle Lot members/Wikipedia Editors Jared Smith and Jordan Smith have been unfairly and abusively banned from editing Wikipedia. Specifically, Administrator Versageek banned Jordan Smith on December 17, 2007 because he kept complaining about Snocrates/Good Ol'factory's misconduct, and then when Snocrates-turned  Good Ol'factory was finally granted administrative privileges, he deleted jsmith51389's user page, which contained a clear explanation of what had happened in December 2007.

First, you assume there is a negative connotation to being from a mexican heritage. To assume some people might view this in a negative light ignores the reality that any statement on a page can be looked at in a negative light by a person. The fact you list Chavez as an American will cause some people to look at him in a negative light. The same issue occurs with him being a union leader (people are against the union). Second, you ignore the fact far more reliable sources, dealing with far greater issues of a need for nuetrality have """"labeled"""" him as a Mexican American.

Firstly, the section on war crimes serves no purpose here except to tarnish the Government.

The discussion of the post-war economics seems to attribute any growth to the IMF/World Bank, inflating their impact by ignoring other elements (in particular, the most important one: there was not an active war going on).    Finally, this is one of the poorest countries in the world and the discussion of the post-war economic situation, which focuses upon the success of the IMF/World Bank policy does not encompass this.

Therefore, in the case of Ethiopian birr, it makes sense to speak about currency of Eritrea between 1952-1960 and between 1993-1997. between 1960-1993, only Ethiopian administration existed, Eritrea had neither sovereignty nor any sort of autonomous rights. (Saying in 1978 that the currency of Eritrea is the birr is like saying in 2006 that the currency of East Germany is the euro.) The same case of Austria between 1938-1945. Even Ukraine and Belarus represents the same situation during their Soviet Union """"membership"""", however, both countries had more or less autonomy and were members of the UN since 1945. I have the fear that the innumerable border modifications in Europe during the XXth century will make huge and complicated succession boxes. For example, after WWII, Slovakia got back not only its Southern territories (Which the 1st Vienna Award awarded to Hungary in 1938), but three villages near to Pozsony / Bratislava (Horvátjárfalu / Jarovce, Oroszvár / Rusovce, Dunacsúny / Cunovo) were awarded to Slovakia (Treaty of Paris) due to strategic considerations. One could say that who cares with three villages, but this territory was part of Hungary between the two world wars - and it is not much smaller than Muraköz (Medimurje)...So I don't think each territorial change must be mentioned in the succession box. Only mention if the currency of a new country / state / autonomous province etc. (so a state-like subject that has the right to circulate its own currency) appears without precedessor (like Eritrean nakfa after split from Ethiopia in 1993, but unlike Ethiopian birr after split of Eritrea) or disappears without successor (like East German mark after the reunificaton of Germany in 1990, but unlike West-German mark after the reunification).For example, German mark or deutschmark was the currency of the Federal Republic of Germany between 1948-2001. It would express that East Germany was simply integrated into West-Germany (contrary to the widely used """"reunification"""" term), at least from the point of view of the circulating currency. It would also express that Germany is not the successor state of West Germany but the same country with an enlarged territory. In the case of the pengő, I would simply say that it was the currency of Hungary between 1 Jan 1927 and 31 Jul 1946. Northern Transylvania, Southern Slovakia and Bácska was totally incorporated into the Hungarian administration. Subcarpathia enjoyed some autonomy, but it was very little and cannot be compared to the rights of then-Yugoslav federal states, present day US states or German federal states.Naturally, this is only my opinion, I would like to know your thoughts.

"List of Mad Magazine issues Hi . Thanks for your recent improvement to this article. Collectonian's point is surely that keeping a list article with the combined tables of contents of all the issues is an honor that we accord to very few magazines. I personally believe that it's justified in the case of Mad, because famous publications deserve more coverage than obscure ones. Irrespective of Collectonian's particular viewpoint, a high-quality list article with lots of references is easier to defend against future requests for its deletion. I haven't studied this one enough to know how it could be improved, but I think your new intro is a step in the right direction. I hope to post again on the Talk but haven't had the time yet. You are one the of the people who I was hoping to get the attention of, because I think only someone familiar with the magazine would have good ideas for how to improve this article.  I read the magazine when I was a kid, but have no idea of how to explain its cultural significance.

"Recommendation  My recommendation is for Skookum1 as follows to get up to speed on how to best use sources on Wikipedia, please pick a topic that you find interesting and write about it.  It might help to create a new article in your userspace, for example.  Then, plan on taking that article through the article improvement process, from creation to DYK, from GA to FA.  Along the way, make special note of how the sourcing requirements get tighter, and how more is demanded from editors.  Of course, the quality of sources will vary by topic, so a lot depends on what you are writing about. I think you'll find that if you are writing about Canadian history, the expectation is that the sources will be of the highest quality and that page numbers will be de rigueur.  Obviously, this isn't written in stone, since guidelines only make recommendations, but the best way to learn about this is by participating in the process.",0

"""OthersExpamplesMexico against Axis - Contributed Escuadrón 201, Pacific Argentina against Axis - Contributed Nothing - in terms of personnel.  RebuttalQuote """"We use the term ‘Grand Alliance’ or ‘Allies’ to describe an activated military alliance in WW1 that included Japan and Italy, and again use the term ‘Allies’ to describe on group in WW2 that does NOT include Japan and Italy. Not a big deal, except of course you can tell the ‘anti-Japanese’ wikipedia sites here because they do not mention Japan as a member of the ‘Allies’ despite it being and undisputed historical fact by English and Japanese historians. how I see it used in Asian history books""""WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? Italy did change sides in WWII and a co-belligerent state supporting the allies established but the RSI was also set up a state in the North, however Japan was NEVER part of the allies in World War II! As for JAPANESE historians and history books – haven’t you heard about Japanese history textbook controversies .  In WWI, Brazil declared war on Germany in 1917, however there was never any formal alliance signed between Brazil and the Entente, the Triple entente wasn’t even a formal alliance, but an agreement – there was a unity agreement, however that stated that they would not seek a separate peace with Germany. Britain only declared war on Germany after it invaded Belgium and the United States declared war on Germany and Austria Hungary in 1917 yet not on Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire. They are called allies because they were ‘’united for a common purpose’’ - the defeat of Germany and or of the Central Powers as a whole, American industrial strength in terms of munitions and armaments also bolstered the British, French and other allies.   In WWII, the ALLIES were overall fighting a common enemy at one point in time, and had a common purpose. SOME countries declared war yet did not send personnel to fight but assisted in the the allies in economic or other forms(severing relations etc.).       Allies amd AxisThe Allies were those countries that joined together in an association against Germany then later Italy and Japan and those countries/movements associated with them(the Axis). In the beginning – Britain and it’s Commonwealth/Empire, France etc. and later countries that joined them against these powers including the US and Soviet Union and exiled governments. There were tensions between the powers especially Roosevelt - De Gaulle and Churchill/Roosevelt – Stalin, however there was mutual co-operation in the form of lend lease and other agreements. On January 1 1942 all of the belligerents signed a document called the Declaration by United Nations - the parties pledged to uphold the Atlantic Charter, to employ all their resources in the war against the Axis powers, and that none of the signatory nations would seek to negotiate a separate peace with Germany/Japan and the other member of the Axis.Not all of the countries delcared war on all of the members of the Axis immediately or some not at all – eg.Brazil only declaring war on Japan on 6/61945. Some countries like only declared war on Japan because they entered to late in the war like Chile, other countries like the Norway and Poland declared war on Japan yet they did not contribute forces against Japan. A Global War""""All I am saying is that if we want to portray that period of history accurately, that in the same way we do not include the Finnish Winter War nor the ongoing Chinese Civil War as part of what we call ww2, that we should record there being 2 separate wars: one in the ‘West’(Europe, Mediterranean) and one in the ‘East’(Pacific and East Asia), and therefore 2 separate groups of friends and foes, 2 separate formations of ‘Allies’. Then we also appear more moral historically.""""""""What I am saying was that the war in Europe and the war in Asia were 2 separate wars. 2 separate groups of alliances. 2 separate military alliances we deliberately, or just simply irresponsibly, confuse by using the same title ‘Allies’ or ‘Grand Alliances’. Once we admit they were 2 separate wars, then it all makes more sense and make us look all the more moral.""""""""So even today, we use the same title of an alliance to refer to 2 different wars at the very same time, in this case, right next to eachother even. But if you tell a Canadian, German or Hollander etc that they are members of the same ‘coalition’ at war in Iraq, they will take great offense at your ignorance.""""''""""I can’t help but wonder if my student is right, and the reason western historian go along with inaccurately using the dangerously over-generalised",0

""": Yeah, well I enjoy ranting but have gotten to do ever-so-little of it thus far on Wikepedia because of the whole infernal """"Wikiquette"""" thing. I couldn't resist the opportunity to indulge a little. ) Here's the dilly (or part of it) on dopamine, melanin and Parkinson's. Dopamine and melanin have very similar structures, and dopamine metabolism produces a form of melanin called """"neuromelanin,"""" which is different from eumelanin, pheomelanin, et cetera, but still certainly a melanin. Neuromelanin gradually accumulates in the neurons of the substantia nigra throughout a person's life. Kids have very little, elderly people have lots. When people get Parkinson's they start losing their neuromelanin, and their SN goes pale. The fairly recently-published histology and pathology books I'm using just take it for granted that the loss of neuromelanin is basically a side-effect of dopamine depletion. But I may have been a little too confident in assuming that that's the final word. I just checked the National Library of Medicine website and a bunch of new research is turning up more immediate connections between neuromelanin and Parkinson's than had been suspected. Also, it looks like they're also getting promising results in studies on therapies that involve endocrine manipulation of neuromelanin. Still, all of this specifically involves neuromelanin in the dopaminergic neurons of the SN, and I haven't personally learned, heard or run across anything stating that there is any connection whatsoever between skin melanin and Parkinson's. But I guess the take home message for me is that there is more going on here than I realized, so I can't write off the possibility that there is alsothough I can't imagine howsome emerging connection between neuromelanin/Parkinson's and a person's skin melanin levels. Anyway, as you say, this article is about melanin generally, not just skin melanin in humans, so regardless the Parkinson's link is legit.  19:57, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",0

"""::: Yes, that was an RPJ rant. But criticism articles really are required sometimes (here's a great example) and often they create clutter if all the separate objections to an idea are left in place. The general rule is that the minority views can be collected as a subarticle, so long as care is taken to treat them as a subarticle by somehow summarizing them in the main article (this does not have to be exhaustive), and vice versa, which probably we should be careful to do in the main JFK assassination article. And so long as rebuttal on both sides is a part of both articles, which I hope we've accomplished here by having a good section on the one-shooter WC view in the JFK assassination theories article, and mentioning that other views than the WC's exist, in the main article.In line with Wikipedia's semi-policy of assuming good faith, the creator of the new article is probably sincerely convinced that there is so much information about a certain aspect of a subject that it justifies a separate article. There is no consensus whether a """"Criticism of .... """" article is always a POV fork. At least the """"Criticism of ... """" article should contain rebuttals if available. And the original article should contain a summary of the """"Criticism of ... """" article. I know I'm going to get flack for pushing so heavily for the WC view even in light of the fact that supposedly it's not the most popular view among the general public. Unfortunately, the general public's view is not informed, and is warped by the slick Oliver Stone JFK, which no movie producer is going to spend as much money to rebutt with a movie which is true to facts as we know them; plus the HSCA shocker with the dictabelt, which got way more airtime than ITS rebuttal, later. All of this being symptomatic of one of the problems which drives WP:V toward untruthfullness, which is that TRUTH is quite often dull and not very entertaining, and sometimes it's hard to find spokespeople for it. Jimbo Wales thinks that if something is true it should have plenty of citable supporters, but sometimes that's just not the case.

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. “Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. “This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” Worship Rights In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. “Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue?

It began in the early 16th century when King Henry VIII failed to receive an annulment from the Vatican and subsequently broke English Christianity away from the pope and declared himself the absolute spiritual ruler of the Church of England. He then proceeded on a campaign to persecute and murder all who opposed his personal claim to the """"English papacy."""" Things only went downhill from there. In subsequent generations the throne passed between Catholic and Protestant heirs, each persecuting their political enemies. The final result came under Queen Elizabeth I which settled England as a Protestant country. In the following centuries, England became the leading herald of anti-Catholic propaganda around the world, as the British crown persecuted Irish Catholics and waged war against the Catholic kingdoms of France and Spain.""""""""Sadly, the more things change the more they stay the same. The world may have moved into the 21st century, but British politics is still locked in the 16th century. To date Catholics are still forbidden from the British royal family. Government officials still mock the pope and the Church behind closed doors. Leading party officials not only refuse to defend the pope's right of innocence until proven guilty, but actually participate in promoting anti-Catholic presumption. Way to go England!

"As Roland perceptively noted, Sand's book is not so much propositive of a theory, as deconstructive of theories about a people. The most invaluable part of the book consists of a perfectly normal historian's history, i.e., of the socio-ideological forces influencing the construction of a modern collective Jewish identity. In this I am reminded of Martin Bernal. His propositive theory, which however took up far more space than Sand dedicates to the Khazars, was almost self-evidently silly. But his analysis in volume 1 of the modern historiography of ancient Greece as that was influenced by racial theory, is still regarded as a tour de force. One doesn't throw the baby out with the barfwater. As to genetics, Sand himself deals with that pp.273ff., and in so far as RS reviews challenge him on this, they cannot be excluded, even if, it's just a personal view, many of those reviews are incompetent and show a lack of familiarity with the book. The criterion should be, genetic criticism or evaluation of Sand should be admitted if Sand's book is specifically targeted or mentioned by those papers, and ignored if not. What should not happen is the application of a double-standard.",0

They signed a publishing deal for a six figure sum and James Fox left soon afterwards blaming fatigue.  However, since then there have been numerous rumors about Fox and his motives for the band. One of the most outstanding, and one that is not going away is that it was all part of an elaborate con. Fox isnt saying that it was, all that he says is that it was part of an art project and if you listen to the lyrics of the songs which he wrote, the story is all there in black and white.

"""""""I don't understand why you think the definition belongs only with momentum/time.""""  the reason is pedagogical within the physics discipline.  it would be a tautology to define the Joule as the amount of energy required to move a body against a force of 1 Newton the distance of 1 meter, then at the same time, define the Newton as 1 Joule per meter.  it's true but it says nothing about the quantities of the Joule or of the Newton (nor anything about their dimesion).  it is not like the chicken and egg, we know which one comes first (meter, kg, second come first, then the Newton before the Joule). the Planck force is a derived unit and will have to be the Planck unit of momentum divided by the Planck unit of time.  the fact that it comes out to be the basic tension in string theory or in, general relativity, the force that is the conversion factor between spacetime curvature and the energy density giving rise to it or, if multiplied by the fourth power of the (dimensionless) circular orbit speed some distance from a central body that it tells what the body would weigh at that distance, all these are fine and good, but they are the result of working out hypothesized physics problems, they are not the definition.  what if you worked out some other basic physics problem (say the basic tension of a string) and it came out to be 2 FP? or 4 π FP?  would you say that the force solutions to such are the definition of the Planck force?  it doesn't matter what the system of units are, once you have those 5 base units defined, there is no freedom left to define the others.  their definitions are purely consequential. i think you need to word things according to the most common terminology.  i fixed it a little more.  i inserted edit notes (invisible) that ask what does it mean to """"distribute energy over a gravitational radius""""? and what does it mean to """"distribute energy over the Compton wavelength""""?  unless you expect your encylopediac readers to know, even vaguely, when or where or how or why such distribution of energy is being done (thus defining the rate of such distribution), why say these words?  also, there still is no citation other than Schwartzchild radius, which i did.  so a reader does not think that this was all just made up, you might want to include references to other stuff. i fixed the convention errors and format errors (some just now).  do a diff comparison to see what i did.

"""  Since the last newsletter, the VisualEditor team has mostly worked on performance improvements, image settings, and preparation for a simplified citation template tool in its own menu.           * In an oft-requested improvement, VisualEditor now displays red links (links to non-existent pages) in the proper color.  Links to sister projects and external URLs are still the same blue as local links.   * You can now open templates by double-clicking them or by selecting them and pressing  .  This also works for references, images, galleries, mathematical equations, and other """"nodes"""".   * VisualEditor has been disabled for pages that were created as translations of other pages using the Translate extension (common at Meta and MediaWiki.org).  If a page has been marked for translation, you will see a warning if you try to edit it using VisualEditor.   * When you try to edit protected pages with VisualEditor, the full protection notice and most recent log entry are displayed.  Blocked users see the standard message for blocked users.   * The developers fixed a bug that caused links on sub-pages to point to the wrong location.   * The size-changing controls in the advanced settings section of the media or image dialog were simplified further.  VisualEditor's media dialog supports more image display styles, like borderless images.   * If there is not enough space on your screen to display all of the tabs (for instance, if your browser window is too narrow), the second edit tab will now fold into the drop-down menu (where the """""""" item is currently housed). On the English Wikipedia, this moves the """"Edit beta"""" tab into the menu; on most projects, it moves the """""""" tab.  This is only enabled in the default Vector skin, not for Monobook users. See this image for an example showing the """""""" and """""""" tabs after they moved into the drop-down menu.  *   After community requests, VisualEditor has been deployed as an opt-in feature at Meta and on the French Wikinews.    Looking ahead:  A new, locally controlled menu of citation templates will put citations immediately in front of users.  You will soon be able to see the Table of Contents while editing. Support for upright image sizes (preferred for accessibility) is being developed.  In-line language setting (dir=""""rtl"""") will be offered as a Beta Feature soon.  Looking further out, the developers are also working on support for viewing and editing hidden HTML comments.  It will be possible to upload images to Commons from inside VisualEditor.    If you have questions or suggestions for future improvements, or if you encounter problems, please let everyone know by posting a note at Wikipedia:VisualEditor/Feedback or by joining the office hours on Monday, 19 May 2014 at 18:00 UTC.

"""    ::We are not editing a physics handbook but an encyclopedia. You may say """"What's the difference?"""". The difference does exist and is crucial for understanding why we need the article. In a physics handbook (or university course) one does not need to present ideas which are not stricly physics but more philosophy. One needs not include all views and even more importantly, to treat them equally. An encyclopedia is completely different. We are supposed to present all the views. We should have articles not only on physical but also philosophical and religious views. We should present not only theories based on shaky ground (like Heim theory) but also pure crap (like Time cube) if it is well known enough (""""newsworthy""""). The articles should inform the reader about the mainstream view on any idea but also on minority views. Therefore, the article is needed as dozens of scholars publish papers on anthropic principle. According to ISI Web of Science there were 13 peer reviewed papers on """"Anthropic principle"""" in years 1991-1995, 18 in 1996-2000 and 45 in 2001-2005. Please, notice the increasing trend.

"""I have to agree with Alecmonroy: A > B is no different than B > A.  What I would recommend is to completely reorganize the section by criticsm, instead of the """"Pros"""" then """"Cons"""" approach.  What I mean is, say the general stuff first, like who is doing the criticizing, who is doing the responding, etc.  Then outline one criticism.  The immediately afterwards mention responses to those criticisms.    Then go onto the next, and so on.  What seems most important to me is how neutrally the prose goes from one to the next.  If it's something as simple as """"A says x, but B say y.""""  Then that's still set 'em up and knock 'em down. Also, using this format, it almost requires a bit extra emphasis given to explaining the criticisms in comparison to the rebuttals.

""" June 2012 (UTC)I think if we remove the plot summaries (not really needed since by then we'll have full episode articles hopefully) that'll give us one row per episode; if we move the columns so the episode title is the first one, not the number, and add """"scope=row"""" to that cell, we'll have us our MOS:DTT table. Having it all in one large table with some indication of season (beyond a season field) like cell shading in the title cell would also be a good idea; that would allow the full list of episodes to be sortable across all columns. On another note; I'm looking at The Post-Modern Prometheus and Deep Throat (The X-Files episode) for possible A-Class candidates; I can't sign off on the latter as I'm the author, but I just need one more say from someone (probably Glimmer) to let Prometheus get the boost.

"Spirituality category changesMy apologies if my actions have been disruptive and thank you for informing me. The spirituality category has a tag on it that it tends to become overpopulated and so I removed the spirituality tag from some individual articles that already appeared at other points within the spirituality category tree. Those articles are all still within the the spirituality category - just at a slightly lower place in the category tree. The categories the articles are in are all in the spirituality category themselves. Most of the articles were the lead articles to categories that themselves appear directly under the spirituality domain (eg spiritualism article is in spiritualism category which is an immediate subcategory of spirituality. So nothing's actually been removed from spirituality at all. But again, my apologies if my actions have been disruptiveBTW, I've just noted from your user page that you have a particular concern with the New Thought movement. I did move several of their pages and they had to go a couple of places down the category tree because of where the current subcategories are. May I suggest that you either move the New Thought sub-category up the tree so that it's directly under spirituality or simply place just the lead article  for New Thought in the Spirituality category if that's your main concern? Spirituality is quite a high domain category so every single article under its domain cannot appear there - most of them will need to be in sub-categories.",0

I do agree that books that contain the non-Catholic view have been consulted; my concern (and that of other FA reviewers) has been in the way that information is presented in this article. The history section should not regurgitate the RCC's view of itself but should reflect the main views that scholars have about the RCC.

""" Withdrawn charges The London Free press also reported that his charges were withdrawn silently. Now from the perspective of a normal criminal process, this usually means the police had a weak case. The fact that the police were gung-ho about this case may also suggest that the police had no case at all (judging by the seemingly high-profile aspect to this case). In other words, Homeontherange's addition of that information is a pretty clear sign that the information is being added in order to disparage James Scott Richardson.What is my point of reference? Well. When I added information to Alex Kulbashian and Richard Warman about a Canadian Human Rights Commission complaint file by Alex against Richard, Homeontherange removed the information stating that the complaint could have been filed, however it wasn't serious enough to because there was no evidence the Commissioner signed off on it. Now, getting back to this case, the crown attorney and/or withdrew the charges because there was no prospect for conviction.To Homeontherange: If you are going to have double standards in """"enforcing"""" wikipedia's criteria for information posted in articles, then that shows your political motivation behind your edits and the way you handle your """"administrative"""" tasks.

We're glad you've decided to join us in our campaign to make the world's largest encyclopedia also the world's most accurate.  We're a collection of people from all sorts of backgrounds, working together to improve articles on a wide variety of topics.

"""   :- Please assume a less dismissive tone. The business  about how a PhD says there is no constitution, because he would help you distinguish between two classes of constitution which are generally understood by students of government and political science  is called, in logic and in rhetoric, reducing your opponents argument to absurdity, reductio ad absurdum. In high school and college debate, you will have points deducted from your side for using either faulty logic or an oratorical trick. Debate judges are neither amused nor impressed, unlike the reporters passing along candidate-employee recaps after a presidential debate in the spin room for national television instant analysis. Here, it just means you have violated one of the pillars of wikidom, collegiality.   :- Sources abound establishing Magna Carta as is a written constitution for the English in 1215, I believe there are earlier such 'written constitutions' elsewhere in Europe. For instance, the golden age of the Republic of Florence begins with the constitution of 1343, earlier """"Captains"""" as you properly call them, were elected in Florence as a legislative body in the mid-1200s. See William R. Everdell, """"The end of kings: the history of republics and republicans"""", ISBN 978-0-226-22482-4, pp.87-107.  :- There is no need to rehearse either the history of written constitutions, nor the history of republics in the U.S. Constitution article introduction.  A couple years ago, I think an earlier version of the section on the 'origins of the constitution' had my contribution referring to the Republic of Venice as a model, quoting from the Federalist Papers, but I think that that was overwritten months ago. Regardless, INTRODUCTIONS require very concise, WP:SUMMARY style.  :- I like San Marino. San Marino made one of my heros, Abraham Lincoln, a citizen during his lifetime.

""" read the truth at http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html Regarding the writer at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hitler_salute    Mr Barlow is a nutter with an obsession. The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is """"covered up"""" by people and also people often refer to it as the """"Nazi-Soviet"""" pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand """"Nazi"""" and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party referred to themselves as """"Nazis"""" (they did not refer to themselves as """"Nazis"""").  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as """"It wasn't invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word 'socialism'!""""  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word """"Nazi"""" to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the Nazi-Soviet pact page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase """"National Socialist."""" The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand """"Nazi"""" even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry's historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry's point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment """"Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It's just a gesture. The Soviets used conventional salutes, does that mean that the US military are Communists because they use the same gesture as the Soviet military!""""   It is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name """"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"""" and also used the term """"Communist"""" instead of using the term """"Socialist.""""  The writer then attempts to avoid the issue, which is the origin of the straight-arm salute, and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether the salutes dictated particular dogmas.  Nevertheless, the writer evades the topic that Professor Curry has raised, which is that Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy were  self-proclaimed National Socialists in the USA three decades before the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Edward's book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including German, which Edward spoke and wrote, and where Edward had studied as a young man) and that Edward's dogma inspired """"Nationalism"""" clubs worldwide including in Germany.     Yes, the """"Roman salute"""" page did once contain innaccuracies, and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point. But that is no reason for the writer to start going on with his use of the term """"conspiracy."""" It's just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia! The point is to correct error when you see it, and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like Dr. Curry.      The writer above also concedes that he is the Wikipedia editor who """"became wiser"""", by incorporating Professor Curry's discoveries.  The writer is to be thanked for crediting Dr. Curry with making it more widely available. It should be noted that the valuable information that Professor Curry provides is his own discovery.  Dr. Curry has also mentioned that the material about the use of the Roman salute in films derives from an academic article by Martin Winkler. Professor Curry pointed out that Martin Winkler did not realize at the time of Winkler's article that the films were all pre-dated by the use of the salute in the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance.  Dr. Curry has also publicly challenged Martin Winkler to debate these issues.  Professor Curry's discovery that the swastika/hakenkreuz, although an ancient symbol, was sometimes used by the National Socialist German Workers' Party as """"S"""" shapes standing for its """"Socialism"""" is also his own original work. And he is right that other writers have deliberate",0

Antandrus (talk)    Viktor Frankl's book Man's Search for Meaning, while not a full autobiography, is certainly autobiographical in nature, and is somewhat less than 300 pages.  JackofOz (talk)    That's a superb book; in fact, the autobiographical portion of it (just the first half) is only 94 pages in my edition. Antandrus (talk)    Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin - Rmhermen (talk)    Erwin Schrödinger's My View of the World (Ox Bow Press, 1983) ISBN 0918024307) is titled My Life, My View of the World in the German original. It is quite short and without chronological order. Schrödinger uses brief and distanced reports on his life as points of departure into philosophical excursions. Killing Time, My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla, A Liar's Autobiography ... -Sluzzelin talk    Black Boy by Richard Wright. Friedrich Nietzsche's Ecce Homo. Primo Levi's The Periodic Table (combined autobiography and science writing, with a little fiction, hugely critically adored, and all in 224 pages). Harry Crews's A Childhood is focused on his early life, but under 200 pages. Slightly more dubious The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (it's actually an autobiography of Gertrude Stein). Maltelauridsbrigge (talk)    Ak! the Periodic Table was my first pick. A Season in Hell by Rimbaud is taught enough. On the Road, an autobiographical novel, at 320 pp, is almost there. Five years of waiting is journalled in Zen in the Art of Archery at 107 pp. Julia Rossi (talk)    My Early Life by Winston S. Churchill, an autobiography of his first 25 or so years and his most entertaining & readable book. In the U.S.A. it was published as 'A Roving Commission'. AllanHainey (talk)",0

However, he was contradicted by the practical examples and stories of Dorje Shugden practitioners which clearly indicate that while legally there may be no ban, from the point of view of discrimination there is clearly a ban in effect and it arises from the Dalai Lama’s words.

"Doc Holliday Photo ProblemYes, I know that that photo of the dark-haird man you used is on file in Denver as Doc Holliday. A different photo (see the collar) from the same photo session with the same man actually hangs in the Cochise County Courthouse in Tombstone, and is also labeled Holliday. But it isn't.The only authentic closeup we have of Holliday is the one in Karen Tanner's book Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait. A standing picture we have of poor quality from 1879 shows he's still the same man by then (still light-haired, as Wyatt says). More importantly, the two closeups we have are of men with different ears.See my note on the Doc Holliday discussion page. It behooves us to get a no-question photo of the real J. Holliday on Holliday's wiki page!  You can leave the other one in, but include a caption that due to the ears, some do not consider it authentic. You can then let the reader judge.",0

It is thus more likely that people use e.g. two transistors in a specific way that would allow to compensate the noise. This is how the basic idea for the bipolar transistor has been discovered by Herbert Mataré in 1942 while he was working on a Duodiode that should allow to compensate the noise in a mixer for a 3 GHz Radar receiver.

"""Alright, we've witnessed an administrative demonstration of power as with the """"protection"""" of the article; thanks Bundy, for your kind warning. Can we now constructively return to the matter in hand? After all, it is the task of all of us Wikipedians to see to it that articles contained in this Free Encyclopedia adhere to encyclopedical standards and not those of the yellow press, isn't it? 'Free' should not stand for 'free of correct facts', 'free of truth(fulness)' or for that matter 'free of ethical restraints'. One would think we all, at least those of good will among us, agree on that. Now it happens to be the case, if not by willful disruptive tendentious editing then by negligence, that in its current state the article Francesco Carotta is full of errors of all sorts and easily verifiably so, some of which were mentioned in the previous, now """"deleted"""" comment. Especially the section on the """"Dutch media controversy"""" is a complete distortion of the real events, for instance, the review of Peter Veldhuisen was not related at all to the activities and pronouncements of van Hooff. This section needs a thorough revision, or maybe the best thing to do would be to just delete it, since it does not provide any information on the theory and might be of interest only to the yellow press. Furthermore, we the Populares, the People's Front of Rome so to speak, hope that it is not considered a personal attack if we dare to ask the reputable user Rubenstein what exactly he thinks it is that qualifies him to act as the expert for and supervisor over this particular article. If User:Slrubenstein does not deem us worthy of an answer, as has been the case a few times on this page, maybe other editors or just readers could try to help us understand. In any case, we fail to see why Slrubenstein's arbitrary words and deeds should carry any special weight for the decent normal Wikipedians. We also don't understand why there seems to be so little opposition to what appears to be his self-arrogated authority.So in closing we ask an unbiased and honest administrator—there certainly must be one around here—to remove the editing protection from the article so that some much needed reasonable work can be done by knowledgeable and sincere editors. In order to prevent tedious unfruitful edit wars we suggest to discuss changes to the article on this talk page first. —   """,0

Plus, it doesn't say anything about censorship on this page. Could someone please answer to this? Not that I recall. It certainly wasn't censored as much as the older games were.  As I recall, some language was censored, some wasn't.  The word """"bastard"""" appeared on various occasions, but """"fuck"""" and """"shit"""" were censored.  < recet indentSome words were censored, some were not, which ones seem arbitrary.Only instance I could find of """"Fuck"""" uncensored:Computer: Cid!

Activating the intercom in the engine section.Cid: Hey goddammit!! Who the #*$$#&'s still in there?Earliest instance of """"Shit""""Shinra Manager: I'm not give in to violence…and I'm not giving you my seat either!Tifa: Barret!!Barret: #^*$!! You lucky #$#*!Cloud: So, what are we gonna do now?Barret: Shit! The hell you so calm about? You bustin' up my rhythm…In total, """"Fuck"""" is said uncensored once, """"Shit"""" is said uncensored 12 times, """"ass"""" is said 15 times (sometimes occuring as Jackass), """"Damn"""" is said 68 times, and I couldn't find any occurances of """"Bastard"""".  Censored words appear approx. 33 times.  My version must be different.  The """"fuck"""" is censored, and the comment with Barret the last editor quoted, the first word was uncensored(though it had an apostrophe stuck in the middle, making it """"shi't"""".  I noted a lot of uncensored """"ass"""" and """"shit"""" though, and after playing FFX and FFXII for so long, going back and playing FFVII, I was a little surprised by the language.  In fact, it's the only Fantasy RPG I've ever played with uncensored profanity.  But yes, it was at least partially censored.  Nevertheless, unless we get concrete primary sourcing from an interview or whatever, we can't include this in the article. — er Well, the box says it's rated teen for mild language and violence...  But I'm not sure of any primary sources that would even deal with this particular issue.. Beyond a mention that there is some uncensored language I really don't think this type of info belongs in an encyclopedia.  And even the slight mention is iffy to me.   Well, it's the first Final Fantasy to come to America with any uncensored language.  But then again, all the Final Fantasies to come to America in that period of time had to go through Nintendo of America's censorship guidelines of the time. It might be worth noting (at least in the discussion) that the computer version was far more censored than the PSX version. Almost every instance of """"shit"""" was removed, consistently with #^$& or similar characters. Also, certain important lines had their translations changed. """"Back then, you could get by with only skinned knees"""", for example, was changed to something likely more grammatically correct, but weird to a long time player of the PSX version.  I have the PC version of FF7 and I recall a TON of Cid lines where there was censorship as well as ones form Barret. They were all situations of anger though so it didn't impact the storyline much.Actually there was some sexual censorship if I recall. """"Slightly stretched underwear"""" was changed to """"Therapeutic underwear."""" Not sure why it's better, but I'm pretty sure they did it because they thought """"slightly stretched"""" was sexually inappropriate.

""":: uhhh, we could also add Standford Shaw on the list and last time I checked, he was a western scholar. As for the rest of your text Mr. Kojian, the fact of the matter remains that there is no concrete evidence written or otherwise that the Ottoman goverment of the time gave explicit or even implicit instructions to exterminate the community of Armenians for racial reasons. Until a time comes where there is substantiative proof that such instructions were given, it is totally misleading to coin the term genocide to the tragic events that unfolded in 1915-16. And it doesnt matter if there were a zillion eyewitnesses who funny enough all turn up to be christians, the most famous of which was Lepsius the racist protestant who was obsessed with preserving the """"good image"""" of Germany.   No evidence?  Oh brother.  Have you read the article?  Believe me, every Armenian in Anatolia did not commit suicide to make Muslims look bad, and Germany look good.  I'm glad you admit though that you don't care if there were a zillion eyewitnesses, since you know better than the people who saw it with their own eyes.    I dont think you get my point which is that your sources of the period in question may very well have been biased maybe? You have to get rid of the typical mindset of  if it supports the genocide thesis, it must be an objective, unbiased source! If not, it has to be someone that is in the Turkish goverment payrolls! This approach of yours and most of those that support the genocide thesis is far from being constructive and is one of the reasons that this issue is not being addressed properly!   Addressed properly? Go ahead and address this.  Did the population of Armenians in Anatolia drop from around 2 million to around zero during WWI and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey?  And did that drop in population take place due directly to actions of Ottoman/Turkish authorities?  Yes or no.  No maybes, no yes but, no nothing else. There is no justification for genocide, and we don't even need Christian eyewitnesses to tell us that the Armenians are gone - while the Turks and Kurds were fruitful and multiplied.    First of all your figure on the number of Armenians in Anatolia is grossly exagerated, Ottoman census figures before the war put the total at below 1 million in the eastern provinces. Even the Armenian patriarchate put the figure slightly above a million so I dont know where you dug that ridiculous sum from (could be your mind playing tricks which happens when you are exposed to too much propaganda)! As for the numbers dropping close to zero, if its the eastern provinces you are referring to, its what seems to have happened as a result of relocation. Have you even bothered to read through the information provided from the Ottoman archives in the links under the section on those that oppose the genocide thesis? If not, it would very well explain your flawed opinion on this subject!  In theory the edit is not so bad. But the problem is that it only gives credance to those that say the events aren't """"settled"""". There needs to be an equal amount of discussion on those that say these things did happen, at the very least. And, to be honest, the edit just throws names around - there's nothing in the articles to say that they have a particular position.   Hellooo, this is the OPPOSITION section of the article. You can include the names of 'scholars' accepting it in the academic recognition section, I've no problem with that. These scholars exactly say the following in their declaration (word-by-word) """"The weight of evidence so far uncovered points in the direct of serious inter communal warfare (perpetrated by Muslim and Christian irregular forces), complicated by disease, famine, suffering and massacres in Anatolia and adjoining areas during the First World War. Indeed, throughout the years in question, the region was the scene of more or less continuous warfare, not unlike the tragedy, which has gone on in Lebanon for the past decade. The resulting death toll among both Muslim and Christian communities of the region was immense. But much more remains to be discovered before historians will be able to sort out precisely responsibility between warring and innocent, and to identify the causes for the events which resulted in the death or removal of large numbers of the eastern Anatolian population, Christian and Muslim alike.

Their site claims to produce stamps using themes that are licensed by various folks that can be used as postage (the site also claims the USPS has authorized this). In Selena's case it appears her estate licensed her image to this company and they produced stamps.

His grandfather began the family's long tenure as pastors of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, serving from 1914 to 1931; his father has served from then until the present, and from 1960 until his death Martin Luther acted as co-pastor. Martin Luther attended segregated public schools in Georgia, graduating from high school at the age of fifteen; he received the B. A. degree in 1948 from Morehouse College, a distinguished Negro institution of Atlanta from which both his father and grandfather had graduated. After three years of theological study at Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania where he was elected president of a predominantly white senior class, he was awarded the B.D. in 1951. With a fellowship won at Crozer, he enrolled in graduate studies at Boston University, completing his residence for the doctorate in 1953 and receiving the degree in 1955. In Boston he met and married Coretta Scott, a young woman of uncommon intellectual and artistic attainments. Two sons and two daughters were born into the family.  In 1954, Martin Luther King became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. Always a strong worker for civil rights for members of his race, King was, by this time, a member of the executive committee of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the leading organization of its kind in the nation. He was ready, then, early in December, 1955, to accept the leadership of the first great Negro nonviolent demonstration of contemporary times in the United States, the bus boycott described by Gunnar Jahn in his presentation speech in honor of the laureate. The boycott lasted 382 days. On December 21, 1956, after the Supreme Court of the United States had declared unconstitutional the laws requiring segregation on buses, Negroes and whites rode the buses as equals. During these days of boycott, King was arrested, his home was bombed, he was subjected to personal abuse, but at the same time he emerged as a Negro leader of the first rank.  In 1957 he was elected president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization formed to provide new leadership for the now burgeoning civil rights movement. The ideals for this organization he took from Christianity; its operational techniques from Gandhi. In the eleven-year period between 1957 and 1968, King traveled over six million miles and spoke over twenty-five hundred times, appearing wherever there was injustice, protest, and action; and meanwhile he wrote five books as well as numerous articles. In these years, he led a massive protest in Birmingham, Alabama, that caught the attention of the entire world, providing what he called a coalition of conscience. and inspiring his """"Letter from a Birmingham Jail"""", a manifesto of the Negro revolution; he planned the drives in Alabama for the registration of Negroes as voters; he directed the peaceful march on Washington, D.C., of 250,000 people to whom he delivered his address, """"l Have a Dream"""", he conferred with President John F. Kennedy and campaigned for President Lyndon B. Johnson; he was arrested upwards of twenty times and assaulted at least four times; he was awarded five honorary degrees; was named Man of the Year by Time magazine in 1963; and became not only the symbolic leader of American blacks but also a world figure.  At the age of thirty-five, Martin Luther King, Jr., was the youngest man to have received the Nobel Peace Prize. When notified of his selection, he announced that he would turn over the prize money of $54,123 to the furtherance of the civil rights movement.  On the evening of April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was to lead a protest march in sympathy with striking garbage workers of that city, he was assassinated.""",0

"Nuclear Reactor Nuclear reactor [1] or a nuclear reactor, a device for performing a set of nuclear reactions under control. The laboratory scale apparatus for the production of specific isotopes, radioactive materials (radioisotopes) Prtvdarvha as well as for medical and laboratory and industrial scale for the production of electricity are made History The first controlled nuclear fission energy was achieved in December 1942. Construction and operation of a cell led by a form of graphite bricks and uranium and uranium oxide fuel successfully concluded. The cell nuclear football at the University of Chicago was the first nuclear reactor was operating.  Reactor Building Despite the diversity of the reactors, almost all of them are composed of the same components. These components include the fuel cover fuel to slow neutrons from fission, cool stacks for transporting thermal energy from the fission process is controlled to control the fission rate. Fuel for nuclear reactors should be such that undergo fission neutrons can be obtained. Five Fissile Nuclides that are currently used in reactors. 232Th, 233U, 235U, 238U, 239Pu. Some Nuclides from the thermal neutrons for fission and some fast neutrons are also produced by fission. Reactor fuel is a difference between property in Uncategorized. The ability of fission fuel used in nuclear reactors must be able to meet other needs. Fuel must be mechanically strong, chemically stable against the radiation damage resistance, so the reactor does not undergo physical and chemical changes. The thermal conductivity of the material must be high enough so that the heat can move easily. It is also possible to obtain, making a comfortable, relatively low cost and non-hazardous chemicals and other benefits in terms of fuel. Pod reactor Nuclear fuels are put directly into the reactor, but has always been used as a cover. Covered or sheathed fuel, moderator and coolant it apart. This corrosion protection and fuel the spread of fission products from irradiated fuel to the environment is prevented. The pods could also fuel support structure and heat transfer to help. Materials such as fuel pods have good thermal and mechanical properties and the chemical interaction with the fuel material is stable environment. It is sheathed with a low cross towards nuclear interactions of neutrons and is resistant against radiation.  Neutron moderator materials A substance that can slow or rapid thermal neutrons are used up. The kernel has a mass close to the mass of the neutron is slow is best. The reactor will be used for the lower neutron absorption cross-section should be. Due to the properties of slow, there are some substances that can be used. Hydrogen, deuterium, beryllium and carbon are some examples moderator. Because beryllium is toxic, it is too low to be used in reactors. The isotopes of hydrogen, heavy water, and the water and carbon, in the form of graphite as a material to be used. Heavy water in some types of nuclear reactors as a neutron moderator is used. They can react with uranium to neutrons. Than conventional light water or water can also be used as a moderator, but because light water absorbs the thermal neutrons are light water reactors need enriched uranium to use high purity, But heavy water reactors can not enrich uranium or conventional uses heavy water so the discussion is to prevent the development of nuclear weapons. Heavy water reactors can be built in a way that requires no equipment enriched uranium to make plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. However, conventional uranium for use in nuclear weapons could be used in other ways, too.This material controls. But in non-industrialized countries like America and Canada, it means much gram and kilogram quantities without any specific authorization of the manufacturers or supplier chemicals supplied. The price per kilogram of heavy water with a purity of 9899% in about 600 to 700 dollars. It also can not use enriched uranium and heavy water plutonium production reactor construction. Just as pure carbon, super slow since the Nazis use of impure carbon use, they did not notice the truth of America's first experimental nuclear reactor in 1942 and the Manhattan Project and the Trinity test of the plutonium bomb, known as «FAT MAN »the manufacture of enriched uranium or heavy water is not used. Cooler Heat from fission in the reactor or fuel must be removed from the heat too high or the fuel rods melt. Heat is the fuel in the reactor power may be used to generate electricity. Characteristics of the coolant should be directed to heat the heat transfer can be effective. Also, chemical stability and lower neutron absorption cross section of two major properties Knndhast cool. Another point that must be noted",0

Sunnis are extremists - no two ways about it But these are the facts and the whole world knows it. Just because you are Sunni doesn't mean you should try to suppress factual comments about your extremist religion. What do you think this war on terror is all about? Who do you think bombed WTC? Who bombed London on 7/7? All Sunnis. Who carried out all those bombing campaign in Bangladesh killing lots of innocent people? All Sunnis. Who is doing all those suicide bombings in Pakistan? All Sunnis. So what is your problem? Why are you so subversive to facts? I thought wiki was all about facts and not POV. May be you should try to do something to fix your religion rather than trying to suppress facts. The facts that everyone knows anyway and your effort is futile. Come out of this Ostrich mentality.

That's not serious.But even if you had 50,000 hits on Google, I might also have refrained from voting. This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article. If I was in your position, I would probably keep my distance from the discussion. You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased. I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy (which applies to articles, but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole). I don't know, and I prefer to abstain from the vote.Understandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don't care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it's up for delete. What do I care. I really don't give a damn. But some jerk says it's non-notable (okay by meI didn't konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer's site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let's take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, """"son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain't right."""" So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don't care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people? Nom.  """,1

"""Actually, I am pretty sure for example Maris Verpakovskis real name is like that, because """"Maris"""" is even Latvian name. At least here in Lithuanian there are both Russians who uses their names as they'd use in Russia and who uses lituanised versions (with endings """"as"""" or """"is""""). Out of Russians who uses lituanised names, many are second or third generation; sometimes parents decides to give children lituanised version of name and surname in those cases, it happens especially in mixed families. E.g. one of Lithuanian football team players is Igoris Morinas; it would be wrong to change it to Igor Morin because Igoris Morinas is his real name. While, for example, real name of the mentioned poolitician is Viktor Uspaskich, not Viktoras Uspaskichas, therefore Viktor Uspaskich is and should be used (and is used that way in Lithuanian wikipedia too). As for Latvian football team, I am not really sure though, but I am sure that for example Verpakovskis is not Mariy Verpakovskiy or something. Maybe someone could shed more light on Latvian policy on names, maybe in Latvia it is different than here in Lithuania, or maybe Latvianisation of name is for example required to get citizenship?

Nine out of ten editors are clearly more interested in scoring rhetorical points and special pleading than in giving a balanced and calm account of the subject  and as usual, those who do try to create a balanced and calm account are attacked by both sides as being unfair.  I think a Parthenon Sculptures article is justified also because if you read art historians on the Parthenon, the tend to include a unified section on the sculptures, indicating that they are considered overall an integral work of art.

"Koala claims that there are no legitimate descendants of the Hohenstaufen, which is a different thing than saying that legitimate male line is extinct. And in this very case, it is incorrect to allege that legitimate descents via women are nonexistent, while legitimate male line descent truly is extinct. They are not the same thing, as those of us who know genealogy, are well aware. I observe that the Yopie has chosen to join the same falsehood. I think Yopie and Koala need to cease their falsehoods and stop those edits of theirs. I understand Yopie is not fluent enough in English (being obviously a foreigner, from Czechia). Those 'warnings' Yopie distributes here and there, are manifestly unwarranted, and rather a signal of twisted tactics in Wikipedia conduct than anything constructive. For example, Yopie sometimes alleges vandalism in clear cases of non-vandalism. Yopie's such behavior should and may lead to him getting sanctioned.   as to Yopie's quibbling using unrelated claims, I suppose he means to say that all female-line descents from all dukes of Anjou are illegitimate. But of course those who know genealogy and titles, are aware that strictly speaking, neither of those peinces actually are 'princes' of Anjou, they would themselves be first to admit that their claim is to the title of duke of that.

"""I take some exception to what you're saying, Xander, though I agree with it in bulk. While there is artistic licence for an heraldic artist to interpret the blazon broadly, I am not at all familiar with any convention allowing for adding embellishments. Can you please provide a reference for same? I am completely unaware of any convention which allows an heraldic artist to add elements that are not described in the blazon. The arms are the blazon, period, and nothing more or less. Beyond My Ken, perhaps a better way to explain this to you... you think the representation of the arms is what matters, yes? That is not in fact the case. Blazons are much more like recipes; Mrs Fields has a single recipe for e.g. their chocolate chip cookie. That is the important thing. Anyone, possessing the recipe, could make a reasonable facsimile thereof. So there's that.However, this is all fairly abstruse heraldic knowledge which not a lot of people know, which gives us the problem you are having; you feel that presenting a given cookie as a Mrs Fields cookie is inappropriate unless it was actually made by Mrs Fields. In one sense, you're right, but you're only right out of totally understandable ignorance of how heraldry works. All that being said, it is true that there are 'official' coats of arms inasmuch as they are the ones approved for use by the holder of the arms. For example, the representation of the Arms of Canada currently in use has been personally approved by The Queen and is thus 'official' for government use.  And with all of that being said: the reference in question does not support the adornments added to the image. It supports only the blazon, and any depiction which follows only the blazon is both heraldically correct and properly sourced. →  ₪ """,0

"Who is minding the minder?  Climategate and Wikipedia == http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/climategate_how_the_cabal_controlled_wikipediaOne person in the nine-member Realclimate.org team — U.K. scientist and Green Party activist William Connolley — would take on particularly crucial duties.Connolley took control of all things climate in the most used information source the world has ever known – Wikipedia. Starting in February 2003, ... Connolley set to work on the Wikipedia site. He rewrote Wikipedia’s articles on global warming, on the greenhouse effect, on the instrumental temperature record, on the urban heat island, on climate models, on global cooling. On Feb. 14, he began to erase the Little Ice Age; on Aug.11, the Medieval Warm Period. In October, he turned his attention to the hockey stick graph. He rewrote articles on the politics of global warming and on the scientists who were skeptical of the band. Richard Lindzen and Fred Singer, two of the world’s most distinguished climate scientists, were among his early targets, followed by others that the band especially hated, such as Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, authorities on the Medieval Warm Period.All told, Connolley created or rewrote 5,428 unique Wikipedia articles. His control over Wikipedia was greater still, however, through the role he obtained at Wikipedia as a website administrator, which allowed him to act with virtual impunity. When Connolley didn’t like the subject of a certain article, he removed it — more than 500 articles of various descriptions disappeared at his hand. When he disapproved of the arguments that others were making, he often had them barred — over 2,000 Wikipedia contributors who ran afoul of him found themselves blocked from making further contributions… In these ways, Connolley turned Wikipedia into the missionary wing of the global warming movement.Let's see how long this Talk comment lasts!  ==",0

"As previously written in discussion, per wikipedia’s own written polices, but immediately deleted by Blackpearl14 and then sanctioned by  “Lessheard vanU”, Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages, and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn’t follow her bias views vandals, attackers and such.   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia’s own written polices.  Sorry, but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.   As recorded, Blackpearl14's pages regarding this issue are one sided, not neutral, are bias, in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.   Yes, Pirates of the Caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral, they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Following wikipedia’s own written “neutral” policy, entire articles would have to be deleted.    Yet Blackpearl14 continues to violate Wikipedia polices and purpose.  Then with IP’s being deliberately blocked and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things, if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to Pirates of the Caribbean following wikipedia’s own written polices, editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason, to delete those articles and ban the IP user.   They use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts.   It’s a total lock out by the editors and administrators, abusing their trust tools, acting like a private monarchy.   To date, Blackpearl14's has proven she has ultimate control, has repeatedly stated that is her purpose, and had even sought to have the articles locked.    Then you “Lessheard vanU” wrote that you don’t want to lock these articles, stating it goes against company policy, but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as “vandals” and “harassing the editors” etc...Other editors and administrators who have proven their practice of bias and manipulative and outright double standards practices include “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and “Chris Mann”.   We have documented that they say one thing, yet practice another.   We have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers.   We contributing writers also wonder just how many editors and administrators have a conflict of interest to various articles.   So since you  “Lessheard vanU” have personally chosen to block IP addresses and made false allegations against me and other contributing people, we are requesting clarification.   When did Blackpearl14 become owner, controller and self judge of certain wikipedia articles?  If you believe that Blackpearl14 owns and has absolute control over Pirates of the Caribbean articles, then please state that is the policy.  Why is Blackpearl14 allowed to violate wikipedia’s own written polices and purpose?  Why are other editors and administrators upholding double standards?  For you can’t have double standards, as the wikipedia written policies detail a cooperative community effort for articles and, it’s suppose to be neutral. Furthermore, there is no way to discuss nor talk about the reckless actions of Blackpearl14 without saying and describing what they are.  Yet, immediately, Blackpearl14 has wrongly and irresponsibly calls anyone placing anything critical or changes to certain pages she had appointed herself as self controller of, as “vandals” and outright claims that she is being “attacked”, and then goes to her peers with which to delete the talk and discussion,  leaving only the editors and administrators’ comments and self bias online, while blocking IP’s.   What is shocking that you don’t know who I nor other contributing writers are.    Why are Blackpearl14 actions being upheld?    Why is her emotional state, calling herself various names in fantasy as she selfishly promotes her personal cause to glorify and promote a cause for her love for Pirates of the",0

"== Overcoming Stupidity ==  Creativity Guru Andy Green in his new book 'Overcoming Stupidity' seeks to redefine stupidity  as 'inflexible thinking' and  develops a graded scale to evaluate stupidity.   In the book he says “Stupidity is not about intelligence – it’s about the flexibility of your thinking. Inflexible thinking leads to stupidity, flexible thinking is the key to creativity. Everyone should be comfortable with their own stupidity – we all make mistakes every day based on inadequate information. We all however, should avoid 5 star stupidity, repeating any earlier stupid acts, and should challenge ‘compound stupidity’ wherever we witness it.”    In 2007 he launched the Stupid Aid campaign, with the principle aim of providing tools to overcome stupidity in the world around us.

"""This is the memo that I meant - by the way my German appears really,really, really bad - the German version appears to be copied from the USA version. Of course this is just one ofmany memos between the participants. I note that the memos that you putforward, however, seem to show that the """"Jewish problem"""" was beinghandled in ways other than gas chambers - ie deportation or sterilization( both rather extreme injustices but not deadly - a little readingshows that Hitler, Himmler,etc... could be quite squimish about killing people (ie the wiki article """"Night and Fog"""" sugggests as much).There has been attempts to question this memo's provenace, however, thismemo is just one of several that follow the same theme - """"leave the Jewish problem alone, atleast till the war is over"""". If there was any gassing - or any murder of Jews - it was being done behind Hitler's back ( and  the backs of anyloyal/ambitious Hitlerites ), a not very plausible scenario, but the one the memos would force on believers. The memo I meant was:""""Mr Reich Minister Lammers informed me that the Führer had repeatedlydeclared to him that he wants to hear that the Solution of the JewishProblem has been postponed until after the war is over. That being so,the current discussions are of purely theoretical value, in Mr ReichMinister Lammers' opinion. He will moreover take pains to ensure that,whatever else happens, no fundamental decisions are taken without hisknowledge in consequence of a surprise briefing by any third party.""""July 1942Unless some scholar can find a memo dated after this that reverses the policy - and I believe all the memos and actions taken by various people (ie Himmler,Luther, Morgan, etc ) instead tend to confirm the policy - it appears that finding a memo with a Hitler ( ie official ) connectionto the Holocaust is just a dream. ( Irving's $1,000 - or whatever amount - seems safe) I hope this memo can make it into the article - ( he may have been a nasty guy but honestly he was probably just a bureaucrat, that seems to be the treatment he received after the war by people on the scene). Browsing/reading the German language wikipedia - I am not really a goodGerman reader but correct me if you are - version of this article itappears they also avoid the relevant memo, but of course they have thefear of prosecution over their heads. In America our reluctance, at least, isn't legal. Finding the Luther memo, it appears this memo is of an even later date. It is even more revealing as to what the policy toward Jews was during the war.All Jews were to be expelled from Europe after the war was over - so it appears Hitler was not talking gas chambers,etc quite late in the war. Memos of this sort seem to crowd all the Holocaust gassing,etc into avery small time frame - an impossibly small time frame, probably why the memos are ignored by all right thinking people.  PS I just found out that the Luther memo has a long history. It has been ignored since at least the 1970s. I thought this was a relatively recent discoveryby scholars etc - it appears to just be an old unanswerable embarrasment to the Holocaust story. Thanks for pushing me to search harder. One of the troubleswith trying to hide or falsify history appears to be that it takes very little workby very unknowledgeable people ( ie me )  to discover the truth.

"""All the sources say it that the Serbs viewed it that way, because of Milosevic's propaganda aimed to start a war in Croatia and to create greater-Serbia. We are going in circles because you are not willing to discuss in good faith. The bottom line is that you claim the Serbs had and lost constitutive status without being able to define the term or to point to the primary source to sustain your suggestion. The other side on the other hand had both defined the term and referenced the primary source. Since you aren't willing to discuss in good faith and since you provided no new arguments during this RfC I suggest we collect the arguments and the sources like in the 1st post and let other experienced editors decide. It's impossible to reach a consensus with someone who is not discussing in good faith. And you pretty much deferred all other editors from this RfC except for me and Director. If he had not shown up, it would end up your way just because of your disruptive behavior that makes people don't care what the article says, just that they don't have to deal with you. You posted a lot of comments without a single new argument and you are trying to push your way against the sources. Your behavior was so disruptive behavior that people rather left the discussion and left the article says 2 conflicting statements in 2 consecutive sentences, than to discuss with you. And this is not your fist time as I can see. I'm looking at your contributions and almost every discussion involving you ends up with a RfC and you constant disruptive behavior. You are constantly trying to ban other people that don't agree with you. There's a written trace to your behavior and it's a shame no one reviewed it.

The previous IPs you used at this discussion were blocked, and now you are using this one, you are evading block, and everyone knows that.  That is why you are being ignored by everyone.  Anyway, this discussion is near over, and it is only Direktor and me still participating.  You desperately called for Joys help but he didn't gave it to you cause Joy is an administrator here and a senior editor who knows to recognize the situation.  Gregor is in my view the finest Croatian editor, initially seems he didn't knew about my sources, but after seeing them he left the discussion by saying that the change in the constitution should be mentioned.  Then Tuvixer who was the editor who first started opposing the denial that was being made by an already senior, but well known as nationalist, editor Shokatz.  And now there is Direktor, my well known college from discussions, the two of us have already discussed here on talk-pages during almost a decade more lines than probably all the books you read in your life. Direktor isn't indeed a Croatian nationalist, and he is participating here because of 2 reasons: he saw here a great opportunity of having a challenging discussion in which he could make use of his argumentative skills which are excellent, and because despite not being a nationalist, he does have some strong pro-Croatian views in the matters of Serbian-Croatian disputes.  He also knows how Serbian arguments about the 1990s are usually weak in sources, not because they may be right or wrong, but because the West backed up quite strongly the anti-Serb rhetoric and, as we are at English Wiki preferably working with English-language sources, that rhetoric ends up usually being easily found.  However, this case is different and the situation was noticed by some editors which know the danger of opposing sources without anything substantial.  You obviously seem not to care about your reputation, otherwise you wouldn't lie as you are doing in this last comments.  Not long ago, you criticized the fact that senior editors have more weight that newcomers (you).  That may seem an unfair situation, but it really isn't, and I will explain you why.

It talks about an out-of-context quote from this very source that appeared for 5½ months in this very Wikipedia article:  ::People say that Jon Stewart has blurred the line between news and humor, but his Daily Show airs on a comedy channel. Coulter goes on actual news programs and deploys so much sarcasm and hyperbole that she sounds more like comedian Dennis Miller on one of his rants than Limbaugh. Consider an exchange on Fox News in June 2001 with Peter Fenn, a Democratic strategist. At the time, Barbra Streisand had suggested that Californians practice more conservation, to which Coulter responded:  :::COULTER: God gave us the earth.  :::FENN: Oh, O.K.  :::COULTER: We have dominion over the plants, the animals, the seas.  :::FENN: Oh, this is a great idea.  :::COULTER: God said, ‘Earth is yours. Take it. Rape it. It’s yours.’  :::FENN: Oh, terrific. We’re Americans, so we should consume as much of the earth’s resources—  :::COULTER: Yes. Yes!  :::FENN: —as fast as we possibly can.  :::COULTER: As opposed to living like the Indians.  ::Coulter and Fenn were both laughing. But her rape-the-planet bit would later be wrenched from context and repeatedly quoted as Coulter nuttiness. “What p_____ me off,” Coulter says, “is when they don’t get the punch line.”",0

The two-sided album was extremely influential. Though side one featured very punk-influenced guitaring, the second side displayed the impressive Death Metal guitarwork of Bill Steer, which would spur the Grindcore movement. The tempos of the album were incredibly fast, with quadruple-time beats and extremely short songs. The album also featured deep grunted vocals advocating leftist politics. Napalm Death followed Scum with the equally extreme 1988 release From Enslavement to Obliteration.

"Please do not remove this as it is sourced documentation.  It is here for those who want to know more about the TIGHAR organization you so whole heartly promote.  It is by author Mike Campbell.    The TIGHAR-Nikumaroro FiascoTwo years of speculation and hype came to a numbing climax onMarch 16, 1992, at the National Press Club in Washington,D.C. At a crowded news conference receiving national TVcoverage, Richard Gillespie, executive director of The InternationalGroup for Historic Aircraft Recovery [TIGHAR], unabashedlyannounced that the Amelia Earhart mystery “is solved.”Since early 1990, following the group’s first excursion to Nikumaroro,a 3.5-mile long coral atoll in the Phoenix Islands, about 2,100 milessouthwest of Hawaii and three hundred miles south of Howland Island,the national media had touted TIGHAR’s theory that Nikumaroro couldbe the final resting place of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan.The “evidence” Gillespie presented included a battered piece of aluminum,a weathered size 9 shoe sole labeled “Cat’s Paw Rubber Co.,USA,” a small brass eyelet, and another unlabeled heel the group foundon Nikumaroro during TIGHAR’s highly publicized return there inOctober 1991. These items, elaborately displayed and labeled in a glasscase, all came from Earhart or her Electra, according to Gillespie.“There may be conflicting opinions, but there is no conflicting evidence,”Gillespie said. “I submit that the case is solved.” Gillespie thenbit his lip and looked down at the floor — a curious yet revealing displayof body language for someone claiming to have solved one of the20th century’s greatest mysteries.Gillespie and Patricia R. Thrasher, TIGHAR’s husband-and-wifeteam, theorize that through a navigational error, Earhart and Noonanoverflew Howland Island and landed on a reef on Nikumaroro duringlow tide. There they died of dehydration a short time later. The plane,they said, was washed over the reef when the tide came in and now liesunder 2,000 feet of ocean.The April 1992 Life magazine featured a six-page spread penned byGillespie, who cites Navy pilot John Lambrecht’s July 9, 1937 report:“Signs of recent human habitation were clearly visible [onNikumaroro], but “repeated circling and zooming failed to elicit anyanswering wave from possible inhabitants.” Gillespie called this report“hugely significant” and “tragically inadequate. What had not beendone in 1937 had to be done now. We would have to searchNikumaroro.”Gillespie credited two retired military aviators, Tom Gannon andTom Willi, of Fort Walton Beach, Florida, for the theory’s origin.“Using celestial tables, Gannon pointed out that on the morning of July2, 1937, the rising sun would have provided the precise line of positionEarhart said she was running,” Gillespie wrote in Life. “By flyingsoutheast along that line, Noonan could be sure that, even if he missedHowland, he would reach an island in the Phoenix group in about twohours. Clearly it was the safest, sanest course to follow. I traced the lineon the chart and read the name of the island: Nikumaroro.”This supposition was convincing to some, but Devine wasn’timpressed. “There is considerable information in Gillespie’s rendition thatcan be faulted,” Devine writes. “One example is his attempt to foster a linebetween Howland Island and Nikumaroro. He presents Earhart’s last messageas ‘We are on line 157/337 ... We are running on line.’Earhart never reached Howland Island. Earhart neversaw Howland Island, therefore Howland Island is not a referencepoint for a landing on Nikumaroro. Earhart’s authenticlast message received by Coast Guard personnel on boardthe Itasca, and recorded by Commander Thompson, relatedno reference point: ‘We are on line of position 157-337 ...We are running north and south.’ Earhart was not flying easttoward Howland Island or Hawaii. She was on a course, acompass course or line of position 157-337, which terminateson the island of Saipan.1With Our Own Eyes– 163 –– 164 –Earhart was not adept at navigation, and may have statedher reading from a pocket compass she carried on her person.She was probably and almost certainly stressed by ensuingevents, especially if Noonan had been rendered unconsciousduring the almost disastrous takeoff of the overladen plane.If Noonan had not been incapacitated, I assure you that he,one of the best air-and-sea navigators of that period, wouldhave",0

"""I'm not following Dennis' logic here. The reference entirely supports the information in the National alliance article (and by the way, that newspaper is at least a worthy enough source as the defunct obscure newspaper where Redwood's letter to the editor appeared that is quoted at length. This is what the Friedman article says:He also suggested consulting with Political Research Associates (PRA), a left-liberal investigative outfit with deep roots in the counterintelligence movement. Among its top researchers is former Public Eye editor Chip Berlet. PRA has been funded, in large part, by Richard Denis-a multi-millionaire Chicago commodities trader who was also one of the largest individual contributors to the Democratic Party in 1993. Bragging that he and researchers had worked with PRA """"for many years,"""" King said: """"They have the best files in the country on political cults."""".........Berlet, like King, has suspiciously changed his public views on NAP over the years. In 1984, when he first took over as editor of Public Eye, Berlet told Newman in a phone interview set up at Berlet's request to set the record straight regarding the Public Eye's 1977 accusation that Newman was a cultist and a LaRouchite, """"I'm the new kid on the block at Public Eye. I'm the new editor as opposed to the old editor, and if there was some way I could avoid having to write articles about this ongoing topic [NAP], I would. Our analysis of your group has changed over the past few years, drastically with my assumption to editor."""" The next issue of Public Eye contained the following editor's note: """"As you will learn from a forthcoming article on Fred Newman and the IWP [International Workers Party, a group that Newman had headed up in the mid seventies], the Public Eye no longer feels it is accurate to call Newman's political network a cult.""""That """"forthcoming"""" article, however, never appeared. Instead, three years later, right after Democratic Party high roller Denis contributed $75,000 to PRA, Berlet's Clouds Blur the Rainbow did.The article clearly cites this in a NPOV manner as a claim that was made in a Newman publication, not as  fact, just like the claims of Redwood and every other critic and self-styled """"expert"""" whose opinions permeate this article to a ridiculous extent already.

""" Recap I decided to withhold further comment until I had some sleep and time to critique the logic behind your deletion decision. I am delaying a trip this morning so that I can provide you with a response to your statement supporting deletion.Your supporting statement for deletion is as follows: """"The result was Delete. The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm, and that the references do not support the notability of the subject. Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted. The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic, and I have counted those opinions as being from User:Julie Dancer. Kevin (talk) """"As for """"The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm..."""" In reality the article title names a type of classification which arranges attributes in order of their significance.  Within the deletion discussion itself the calim is made by  at  that other algorithms exist, namely Examples of relevant works are """"A Fast, Bottom-Up Decision Tree Pruning Algorithm with Near-Optimal Generalization"""" and """"An Efficient Algorithm For Optimal Pruning Of Decision Trees"""". which are capable of performing the function the article title names:If this is accurate then the right way to handle a necessary correction would be to add these algorithms to the article instead of nominating the article for deletion.In anticipation of these other algorithms being added I immediately changed the body of the text to read """"The algorithm used for this purpose..."""" to """"One algorithm used for this purpose..."""" Since I do not now have access to the article's history as the result of your deletion I can not give you the exact date and time. However, it was prior to the end of the deletion discussion. (Incidentally, it has been suggested by a Professor at Cornell that deleting the article was for the purpose of eliminating the article history.)Normally as a Wikipedia user I would expect other users who have an issue with such wording to correct it themselves as this is one reason the Wikipedia was setup this way. The Wikipedia still claims to be """"...the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.""""  The impression I have now is that while there were an abundance of editors in the beginning who edited articles that there is now an abundance of spoiled children who expect articles to be perfect from the beginning or for someone else to edit them. They simply do not understand that each article is considered to be a work in progress and the Wikipedia being an opportunity to learn how to write and to edit rather than being completed. Instead of doing any work themselves they find it much easier to go around deleting articles which remain incomplete or have not yet reached a state of perfection, especially a maintenance edit like adding an inline reference that would require them to do any real work themselves. As for """"...references not supporting the notability of the subject"""" You can not logically make this statement without reading the reference or references first and you certainly can not follow this with a statement like """"Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted."""" All of the arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted in the text of the primary reference to which I deferred. Just as you saying that a stop light was green in a court of law when you did not look at the light would be a lie so would be claiming the reference did not support notability when you did not read it. I know you did not read the primary reference because all arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted by the both the primary reference and the references it contains.As for """"The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic... This shows you did not read or comprehend the response I made in the deletion discussion or only scanned it. I explained that each of the user names were created so that I could track the use of my own resources better, similar to the need on the part of the Wikipedia to require bots to have their own user name even though several may be owned by the same user. Eventually at least one of my computes will be used to accommodate bots, but currently I am able to meet all of my needs by downloading the Wikipedia and mining it off line.Since the existence of the alternate user names was stated and known by all from the beginning of the deletion discussion there is no w",0

"""Others have reinstated my close twice now, which I'm perfectly fine with.  I'm more than willing to defend the close if need be.  The MFD was the fourth forum where the discussion had been brought.  In NONE of those forums was there anything near a consensus that Cla should delete the advert.  The issue failed to gain actionable traction on ANI nor on Jimbo's page.  And future discussions were unlikely to garner consensus.  Thus an RfC was opened.  Once the RfC was opened, which is calling for a wider community input, then the RfC should have run.  The MfD might have been appropriate if the RfC was clearly going against Cla's stance; but it wasn't.  Thus a FOURTH discussion was opened.  Unfortunately, having 4 discussions opened in such a short period is not going to result in a different result as it is more likely to simply attract the same voices that have chimed in 3 other places.  This MfD's action is not an indicator of how well watched MfD is, but rather how controversial the debate is elsewhere.  Opening it was a clear case of ForumShopping and it should have been closed immediately as such.  If I read the comments and thought a consensus might be reached one way or another, I wouldn't have closed it.

"In 1912 (long before Landis) Cobb attacked a fan in the stands and was suspended. The fan was indeed handicapped, but he was also hurling vile words at Cobb, who wouldn't put up with it. His teammates went on a one-day strike, then came back when told they would be banned from baseball if they didn't. Cobb did not escape suspension, he served it. The allegations against Cobb and Speaker in the mid-1920s came from another ballplayer, about a game several years earlier. It was that one player's word against theirs, hence insufficient evidence. Landis didn't hesitate to punch out the big stars (like Ruth) when it seemed warranted. The stats for Jackson in the '19 Series don't suggest he did anything much to help his team win. I don't know that he denied throwing the Series, some sources claim that. But did he keep the money? Far as I know, he did.

"""If you think that Vaishnavas are born and die - than you are not to be delivered for millions of kalpas:I am sorry, but this is fact:""""Anyone who does not float in this inundation is most condemned. Such a person cannot be delivered for millions of kalpas.PURPORTThe kalpa is explained in the Bhagavad-gītā (8.17): sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ. One day of Brahmā is called a kalpa. A yuga, or mahā-yuga, consists of 4,320,000 years, and one thousand such mahā-yugas constitute one kalpa. The author of Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta says that if one does not take advantage of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he cannot be delivered for millions of such kalpas.""""However, you are lucky:Q.    Can Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata be distributed to the common people before they have read the Gita and Bhagavatam? A.    Yes, Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata can be distributed along with the Gita even before Bhagavatam according to Shrila Prabhupada’s purport on Cc Adi 8.36. In the first part of the purport he explains that Shrimad-Bhagavatam is difficult to understand for the common man due to four reasons: (1)  It is very elaborate due to it being the commentary on the the highly condensed Vedanta-sutra and it is in Sanskrit which is a very difficult language to understand for the common man thus few men can understand its purport.(2)   Professional reciters have created the impression that Shrimad-Bhagavatam deals only with Krishna’s rasa-lila and thus presented Krishna as a great woman-hunter.(3)  Professional reciters have introduced bhagavata-saptaha, or seven-day readings of the Bhagavatam. Then Prabhupada explains that under these circumstances, it is a great aid for the common man to read Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s Chaitanya-bhagavata, for thus he can actually understand devotional service, Krishna, Lord Chaitanya and Nityananda. Due to misunderstanding Shrimad-Bhagavatam, people are misled regarding the science of Krishna. However, by reading Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s book one can very easily understand this science.          So it is pretty clear that Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is a great book to introduce to the common people who normally may not have the required intelligence & patience to understand the most elaborate Shrimad-Bhagavatam        Also Shrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has said said that Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important than Chaitanya-charitamrita for the common man because it is a lila-grantha. Without describing so much about philosophy, it describes the lila of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and is therefore easy for the common man to follow and understand the philosophy. Even though Sarasvati Thakura himself mostly explained philosophy, he said that philosophy is only for the greatly learned people, and for the common men Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important. So he said, """"Read Chaitanya Bhagavata from time to time."""" If anyone came to him he would ask them if they had read Chaitanya Bhagavata. He often asked people this, including non-devotees. He recommended that for ordinary people, the first Vaishnava literature they read be Chaitanya Bhagavata. Q.Then why did not Shrila Prabhupada explicitly tell us to read this book and distribute it in mass quantities? A.    One immediate answer is because Shrila Prabhupada had not translated the book. Shrila Prabhupada did give great importance to Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s pastimes that is proved by the fact that he left the translation of the Bhagavatam in middle to complete Shri Chaitanya-charitamrita. So actually he did’nt have time to translate Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata. Although Prabhupada has said that his books are enough, he did say that reading Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata will be a great aid for the common man, that one should read this book if he has to preach the gospel of Lord Chaitanya, that readers will profit much by going through Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata (SB Intro). So I would say that it is not against the teachings of Prabhupada to introduce this book with the original Bengali verses & translation to the common people. Q.   But the translation is not done by Prabhupada. So how will we know whether it is bona-fide? A.    Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is full of very simple but very sweet Bengali verses which are very easy to translate into any language if the devotee translator is  little intelligent and has a little knowledge of Bengali (which is very easy to get).

As I indicated in the edit summaries, some of your statements are totally incorrect; this casts doubt on the accuracy of your edits generally.  In several places you removed clear existing text and replaced it with confusing, even incoherent or unrelated statements.  Sub-standard English is a large part of the problem.  It might be best if you had someone check your grammar and spelling prior to editing articles, rather than work on Wikipedia alone.    Please keep in mind that substantial changes should be sourced, regardless of who is giving you information.  Be careful not to add (or substitute) information that represents original research.  Also, you might want to read WP:FIVE as a basic introduction to Wikipedia policies.   How you explain  and . You said my information I add to Uranus and Neptune is not right. The sunlight on Uranus and Neptune is like 50 to 100 feet away from candle, 400 and 900 times dimmer sunlight. O my god, that's alot . It's like total blackness a dark swirling mass is below my feet in orbit. That's like a candle light halfway down my high school campus. I hadn't found any information about uranus and Neptune's total blackness69.228.145.50  I do not think you have read what I wrote above, or studied the policy pages I linked to.

If you insist upon doing so, and go on in the same manner as before, your edits are almost certain to be reverted as unsourced original research or unclearly expressed.  I would advise you instead to postpone editing for now and learn as much as you can about the science, and also to concentrate on improving your command of English.   Then how you know Jupiter's sunlight is 27 times fainter? That's what you fix by, then would that mean Jupiter is 27 times dimmer? Less sunlight, thne the planet is dimmer.

You said the statement suppose to be source, then how you got those informations from?69.228.145.50  It simply comes from the inverse square law.  The mean distance of Jupiter from the sun is  approx. 5.2 astronomical units, whose square is 27; a bit more accurate than 25 (based on 5 A.U.) Bear in mind that that is incident light.

The gupta's were the once, who made hinduism established in northern india. This was done by patronizing the Sanskrit language. Previous religions got lesser attention since then. Gupta's were the Hindu patronizers. So this is the time of the rise of """"modern Hinduism"""" in India, which took place til the use of Sanskrit language was minimized in the later middle ages due to persian and other ethnicity's rulers.2.) This article should present the History of Hinduism, NOT the """"history of buddhism"""", or the """"history of buddhism in India"""". Therefore very special related buddhism stuff were removed. I didn't look at the muslim part in the article so far, but it should be done either way.3.) Of course Asoka was once converted to buddhism. But since then he had sent his buddhist monks to all parts of his empire. He wrote his beliefs into the edicts of ashoka, which reflect his buddhist identity. He patronized buddhism. Since he was buddhist by heart, there was nothing to mention about him regarding hinduism apart of the contemporary compiled Sanskrit literature of oral tradition. I know, many indians would like to see him as hindu patronizer, but he wasn't at all. These were only the Guptas and Pallavas in ancient days.Large parts of these points can be seen here:http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555715_9/hinduism.htmlI hate it, when people from germany or german speaking people, especially those, who claim theirselves Aryans, make history articles in the indian section.

"""Possible copyvio, but no big deal. I just read a long review by a university professor or student and recognized several phrases. We should probably give credit for these. I'll try to google it up again.  Review of 1984 versionHere is a copyrighted review or summary:In 1984, the movie The Bounty starring Anthony Hopkins as Bligh and Mel Gibson as Christian was released. The movie is set during the trial of Lt. William Bligh upon arriving home after the mutiny had occurred. In this movie, the events of the voyage up to and after the mutiny are shown as a series of flashbacks.Bligh is not so much portrayed as a cruel tyrant in this film, but rather as a traditional ship's captain - a man of his times. While some savage beatings were carried out under Bligh's watch in this film, it seems to be in this film no different than any other captain would have done.The crew is shown in a different light than in the previous two films. They are shown to be a much more """"rough and tumble"""" group than the crews in the other films. Many of them are shown as typical sailors of the time. Their motivations in this film are not always as noble as in the other two films.In this film, Fletcher Christian is a more complex character. He is shown at first as a friend of Bligh. At first Bligh thinks so much of Christian that he asks the man to sail with him for a second time. However over the course of the film both men turn against each other. The feelings become much more acrimonius after the ship leaves Tahiti after Fletcher has been forced to leave his wife behind on Tahiti. In this film, she is more of a reason that Fletcher mutinied than in the previous two films. Afterwards, Fletcher is shown as feeling remorseful because of the mutiny. He tells another mutineer that he wished he had given Bligh some muskets.In this film, the crew is shown as having more responsibility than they did in other films. This film does not so much hold Bligh as responsible - rather it is the desire of some of the crew to go back to Tahiti. However, it does make the fact that Bligh was going to try circumnavigation as one of the reasons that some of the crew decided to mutiny.Like the 1935 film, this version also concentrates on the trials of Bligh and those who were forced into the launch with him. It is the only film to show that one man died because of an attack by the natives of an island where the launch stopped.  Once Bligh's launch reaches a Dutch colony, his part in the story comes to an end. It shows the later voyages of the Bounty as they go to Pitcairn Island. It then goes to Bligh's trial where he is subsequently acquitted by the Admirality.The 1984 film was probably one of the more historically accurate of the films dealing with the Bounty. It shows both Bligh and the crew as more products of their time than anything else. This film also suggests that the motives behind the mutiny might not have been as noble as suggested in the other films. It also portrays the natives mostly nude as they would have appeared at the time of The Bounty's visit to the island (the previous films couldn't portray this because of censorship and decency concerns).Despite the distinguished cast—including Daniel Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson in supporting roles and Laurence Olivier in a cameo appearance as Admiral Hood—the film had a tepid critical reception (the capsule review in Newsday read in its entirety as follows: """"Man the bilge pumps"""") and was not a great commercial success.

"""Follow-up.You reduce """"false rape"""" claims to people (women) changing their minds. But if rape is sex without consent, it does not require anyone changing his mind. It can be people feeling ambivalent or curious beforehand. Ambivalence or curiousity do not imply consent. Cooperation does not imply consent. And you cannot prove consent unless you have maybe signed a consent form, into which you could have been tricked / coerced to sign. Don't you see the huge plunge into plain old fashioned insanity the legal system takes when rape is sex without consent?I am aware that it is hard for women to get rape claims heard etc, I am aware of that. What I am trying to explain to you is this is exactly the result of exaggerated rape claims. If rape was just a special form of assault, there would not be little misunderstanding to what constitutes a rape and what not. This would serve the potential victims as well as everybody else, especially the legal system and the police.I am not familiar enough with the example of South Africa that you bring up. From experience, if a statisticly huge drop like 60% in a short time for something that is greatly influenced by social mores (which usually take ~50 to 150 years to change), then this is most likely caused by a change in the way the figures are obtained.You bring up the example of date rape not being covered by the definition of """"sex by force"""". You have some pretty messed up ideas. Drugs are force. For example, the police tries to use knock-out gas to remedy certain hostile situations, and they refer to these gases as """"non-lethal force"""". Similiar to another example, where people are """"just holding you down, not hurting you to rape you"""" - holding someone down - by force - is force. Locking someone up in a basement, only to offer food and water in exchange for sexual service - is also using force (if you have thought about bringing that example up).The second half of your post mostly rambles about how expensive guns are. Yes, they are way too expensive, but the reason for them being expensive has a lot to do with government regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of firearms. As for an unsightly bulge when carrying a weapon - I've got some more unsightly bulges than that, and women tend carry purses perfect for concealed carry. So, women have an easier time to carry guns. God, I want it to be socially acceptable for men to carry a purse. But then again, it looks like total ass.Every civilized society requires all its citizens to be armed at all times. Because violence is the very foundation of a state - The state removes the right to be violent to each other from the people, and instead claims a monopoly on violence, and resolves disputes with a legal system, and enforces the laws with an armed police force. But when the state is the only one controlling violence in its controlled territory, nobody controls the state to prevent government abuse, totalitarian laws, dictatorships. Aside from discouraging small time petty criminals, an armed civil population has the benefit of being able to remove a government once it no longer serves its purpose - that is, the well-being of the citizens - and replace it with a new government, preferrably with the severed heads of the old goverment decorating the state capital just to remind the new goverment what happens when they step out of line. As such, any effort to outlaw an armed civil society must be punished harshly.""",0

"""Recent revertsWith regards to this, this, and this revert, which I rolled back here, here, and here, the statement added by the anonymous editor that the town """"was known as Abdalyar until 1923"""" is not only unsupported by the source being cited, but also contradicts it (Pospelov states that the name of the town was changed to """"Lachin"""" in 1926; 1923 is when town status was granted). Now, I don't know if there was a name change in 1923 and then another in 1926, but if there was, it will need another reference to support it. Here is what Pospelov says, verbatim:As can be seen, there is no mention of a renaming in 1923.— • (yo?); June 24, 2015; 14:12 (UTC)""",0

The other cities have begun to protest to support the main protesters in Istanbul from their own locations not necessarily to move and participate directly in Istanbul.  News are pouring gradually.

However if this event expands to many more locations and evolves from the environmental perspectives to another ones (i.e. political, ideological, anti-government motives), then the title can be changed.  One simple example: Think that World War 1 started today (not between 1914-1918). We cannot know and make any assumption that after """"the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on 28 June 1914"""" World War 1 started because simply, we cannot know what happens afterwards.

"""  == Harp Twins article ==  Dear Bgwhite,  I hope you are back to 100% now. I also hope you saw the nice message that I sent you, wishing you a speedy recovery, with a painting that I drew just for you. The painting messed up your page format terribly, but my intentions were good.   Enough with the insincere formalities! LOL Look, Bgwhite, you know the nightmare that several of us went through with the Harp Twins article. I made many mistakes, partly because I was young and stupid, and to some degree because I did feel as if others provoked me, even though I don't claim to be less responsible than them for that disastrous situation. As you know very well, I'm in the Wikipedia Sons of B*tches Hall of Shame. Anyway, although I did agree to not edit the article (and I complied for a very long time), I'm not a fan of those girls any more, as I told you a few months ago. So at that point I helped Wayzgoose learn how to update the article because I had lost interest (you can see that he has made several edits).   However, I simply could not let the creator of the article (Crowdsalesmed) get away with a recent edit. Oh, by the way, I see a brand new edit from that user now. Crowdsalesmed removed the remarks made by Megan Bledsoe in a thesis for a Doctor's degree in Harp Performance. The reason? The observations are not very flattering. But even when I was a fanatical fan of those girls, I actually was very impressed and pleased when Lesser Cartographies found that reference and added it to the article. The fact that the Harp Twins were mentioned in an academic paper shows more notability, in my opinion, and I thought it was a great contribution to the article. Besides, you don't need me to tell you that an article should show different perspectives about the subject, not just the flattering ones. That's the whole point of the NPOV policy, right? Neutrality. Or else we have a promotional article instead of an encyclopedic article. So I reinserted those observations. Megan Bledsoe is an authority on the subject. Notice in the edit description how Crowdsalesmed mischaracterized Megan Bledsoe to get rid of her. After I reinserted the information, Crowdsalesmed removed it again, this time claiming that I had no right to edit the article because you had blocked me. You can see what I wrote in the edit description when I added the reference a second time. But now that contributor has distorted the reference (introduced by Lesser, as I said), to minimize Bledsoe. Instead of """"Music theorist and harpist Megan Bledsoe"""" it reads """"Harp player Megan Bledsoe"""", and instead of """"remarks"""", it now says """"remarked in a personal thesis paper"""". I think that's massive POV going on. """"Personal""""? That was for the University of Washington!   I will let you decide what to do with that, although I know you have much catching up to do with your administrative tasks. But really, I couldn't just watch that happen. It would be immoral to do so. Although I had huge disagreements with Lesser and Duff at the time, I do believe that they were essentially trying to keep the article neutral. Perhaps at some point their feelings towards me got in the way a bit, but they both had valid points for sure. I still think Duff should not have come back to the article after voting to delete it, but he didn't break any rules in that sense. If I had not reinserted the Bledsoe remarks, it might seem as if I merely pretended that I was no longer a Harp Twins fan, to then let the article get out of control little by little, more and more promotional, having sort of gotten Lesser and Duff out of the way. That would have made me look despicable. So yes, I edited the article without your permission, but it was to reestablish neutrality by merely reinserting what Lesser had put in there. I did it twice, but Crowdsalesmed can't handle that observation that Bledsoe wrote. I don't want to fight on that article any more. As I said, I have lost interest and I'm tired of fighting there. I hope you understand. Could you please add that article to your watchlist again so you can keep it balanced? And please check that last edit, which I already explained to you (Bledsoe is being mischaracterized in the article now, which is worse than doing that in the edit description, of course).

You also don't need a separate gallery, which saves space.  And, although the textual-info is relatively compact, and the pics are lined up with the textual-info, you don't need to have vertical column orientation (like option#C) and you don't need to have excess whitespace (like option#D and like the dem-list or the potus-list).

"""== Audio File ==DCGeist is vandalising this article by repeatedly removing content while refusing to exaplin the problem or start a discussion to correct the problem.  The problem, he says, is """"style"""", which he believes """"very clearly explains the problem"""".  He prefers to delete content rather than help to edit the page to allow its inclusion.  Is United States to be the only country in the Western Hemisphere without an audio file for pronunciation of the name? When did """"style"""" become so important that it justifies the deletion of content over style correction?   The addition is ungrammatical.It clutters the article's opening sentence. It is visually off-putting and difficult to read. This is a very significant stylistic concern; by contrast, the addition of an audio clip pronouncing two common English words is a minor and unnecessary matter of content.—   Could you explain why you think the addition is ungrammatical in the parenthetical comment?  Do you have a proposed solution that will avoid deleting content, or is deleting content your purpose?  The opening can be reworded, rather than deleting content.  Please note that the pronunciation, even of """"common"""" words in English is of value to both non-native speakers as well as native-born speakers, since even common words may change pronunciation within a proper name.  Please justify having only one country in North America whose article is forbidden to contain an audio file.   While remaining mostly neutral on this front, please don't call something """"vandalism"""" when it's not. This is a disagreement, and under the terms of """"Bold, Revert, Discuss"""", the onus is actually now upon you to justify its inclusion, not the other way around. But either way, it's not obvious vandalism. It annoys admins when people throw that term around. Or at least me. And as for """"Is United States to be the only country in the western hemisphere"""", I point out that """"United States"""" is the only country name in the Western hemisphere made up entirely of common words, without proper names. (""""of America"""" is different, of course, but the audio file isn't about that name) So there is an argument to say that it is the country least in need of a pronunciation guide, since there's no unusual or proper words in that particular name.   But """"united"""" contains vowels which do not behave in the way that non-native speakers expect.  I have taught English overseas, and have seen the problems firsthand.  The word """"united"""" has no encyclopedia article here, nor pronunciation given, for a non-native speaker to examine.  Also, the word """"states"""" is a plural, and English plurals have two possible pronunciations for the added final """"-s"""": /s/ or /z/, according to rules that native speakers learn but which non-native speakers struggle with.

This will be of relevance and value for many of the 20th Century engine designs, and in this case would permit the GM connexion to be referenced more accurately. I would propose:  ::: """"Designer - General Motors (1959/60), Rover (1965-67)"""".   ::This could then facilitate the deletion of the """"Also Called Buick 215"""" field, which is inaccurate. By that measure, the Triumph 1500 engine would be """"also called"""" Standard 8, when the development in the interim years was sufficient for the engines to share almost nothing in terms of tooling or componentry. An RV8 is definitely not a Buick 215 - even the casting method was altered. This also adds to my above argument that Production should count from 1967 onwards, with the general purpose being to differentiate the Rover-ised engine from its design origins in line with what I believe is the scope of the article.  ::How do we feel about that sort of change (provided Designer can be added to the infobox)?

I am neither a """"Conservative"""" or """"Liberal"""", and do not affiliate with the political """"right"""" or """"left"""". I also do not support either mainstream political party in the United States.  This article states, implies and attempts to reinforce several times that Hitler was, in some way, a """"right-wing"""" extremist or """"Conservative"""".  """"The Weimar Republic had never been firmly rooted and was openly opposed by right-wing conservatives (including monarchists), communists and the Nazis.""""  ...that also seems to imply that communists and monarchists are also """"right-wing"""", which is untrue.  """"Another candidate was a Communist and member of a fringe right-wing party.""""  ...here we go again...  """"Bal Thackeray, leader of the right-wing Hindu Shiv Sena party in the Indian state of the Maharashtra, declared in 1995 that he was an admirer of Hitler.""""  ...now I have to question the idea that Hindu Shiv Sena is actually a """"right-wing"""" party. It all depends on who's writing the article I suppose. If it's a """"Conservative"""", he'll turn out to be a batty commie. If it's a """"Liberal"""", he magically turns out to be a far-right, racist koo-koo.  Other articles all throughout Wikipedia have the same """"spin"""" attached to them, but it's outside the scope of this appeal for the most part. However, if you go to the """"far right"""" article, you are bombarded with the idea that """"Far Right"""" means such things as racist, authoritarian, totalitarian, militant, etc. This is simply untrue, just as untrue as saying the """"Far Left"""" is all about creating Soviet-like, autocratic states and domestic oppression.   The whole concept of wrapping all political ideals (and politicians) into the simpleton's explanation of politics we call """"wings"""" is misleading and inaccurate. The definition changes from person to person, viewpoint to viewpoint and even country to country. Therefore, I think it wise that Wikipedia stay clear of treading this ground except where it is absolutely necessary. Here it is not. We need only describe what Hitler believed, what happened and what he did. There is great debate among political scientists about how Hitler, Nazism and """"fascism"""" should be classified; or if it is even possible by conventional means. The very concept of """"left-wing"""" and """"right-wing"""" comes from the French Revolution, where the """"right"""" meant those who sat on the right and supported the king (monarchists). This was obviously not a good thing to be at the time. The definition of """"right-wing politics"""" grew out of that, and has never been defined neutrally. When you define the position of your opponents, you tend to set up a straw man. The spectrum itself is inherently flawed to begin with; no real political spectrum could be linear. It totally ignores the complexities of political science and makes no attempt at explaining how particular groups can be identified with one """"side"""", yet interpolate between the """"wings"""" on particular issues. If it were presented to Wikipedia today to be verified, it would be rejected.  So I STRONGLY suggest we remove ALL talk about what """"wing"""" people were from the article. It will only serve to confuse, mislead and even offend. It contributes absolutely nothing to the article and its information; save possibly advancing the political positions of the writers.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  ([[User talk:67.142.163.29|",0

"""      THE unions' claim for a 3.8 per cent minimum wage rise has collided with the most unfortunate circumstances.  In all likelihood, the ACTU leadership knows it doesn't have a chance of winning the $21 a week it wants while the economic outlook is so bleak. But other significant factors also conspire against the success of the claim.  The 1.3 million employees on minimum pay rates starting at $543 a week are typically in low-paid retail and hospitality areas.  Their employers are already upset they face a substantial lift in penalty rates over the next few years because of an """"award modernisation"""" process, ordered by the Rudd Government, to realign the nation's minimum pay rates. In essence, many employers will be forced to lift penalty rates by 20 per cent for the sake of creating a simpler, homogenous pay system from state to state. No wonder employers are unhappy at getting slugged an extra 3.8 per cent as well.  The union claim also coincides with the introduction of Labor's IR laws, which will replace John Howard's Work Choices once and for all.  There are risks, as the Government's own explanatory memorandum acknowledges, that restoring """"fairness"""" in workplaces could come at a cost as restored unfair dismissal claims and stronger union bargaining power adversely affect employer attitudes to hiring people.  The overriding difficulty for the union claim is undoubtedly the economy and jobs.  It was not surprising that ACTU secretary Jeff Lawrence yesterday denounced employers wanting a """"pay freeze"""" until the economy improved.  But Lawrence went much further, dismissing a link between minimum wage rises and the jobless rate, and personally attacking the Fair Pay Commission's chief Ian Harper for lacking impartiality. (This is the same Harper who dished out 4.1 per cent last year, by the way.)  It obviously irritates Lawrence that Harper has indicated he will consider the impact of the Government's cash handouts and tax cuts in his wage decision. For Lawrence, nothing less than compensation for cost-of-living rises is acceptable, and he dismisses business claims about wage rises causing higher unemployment as """"self-serving and misleading"""".  Yet surely the Government's position indicates the views of Harper and employer groups are not rabid.  Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan accepted what Lawrence would not: they said employment was the primary consideration.  In fact, accepting wage trade-offs and discounts that take account of social welfare payments is nothing new for unions. Such deals were typical of the Hawke-Keating government accords with the ACTU. They were paraded as economic responsibility.  Your Comments:  2 Comment(s)  Jack Schitt of Newie 9:20am April 08, 2009  Well John O¿Hagan of Melbourne, I¿m glad that your quick little Google search was more effective than the 5 years of economics study I completed at university. To say that there is no link between unemployment and minimum wage, because some idiot calling themselves an economist wrote a paper on it is akin to saying that evolution did not happen because there¿s this bunch in the States who have this creationist museum¿ Of course the secretary of the ACTU doesn¿t believe this ¿ and nor did his predecessor ¿ however their jobs rely on holding this belief. Making the argument that there is no nexus between the cost of labour and the amount of labour employed makes you look like an economic flat-earther. Might be time to go back to Google¿  John O'Hagan of Melbourne 2:09pm March 27, 2009  Rather than merely assuming that wage rises and labour regulations cause unemployment, as does the author of this piece among many others, let's look at the facts. Many comparative studies have been done on this subject; typical is one from the Journal of Economic Perspectives (vol 11, no 3, 1997), but just google them yourself like I did, it's not that hard, Mr Norington! These studies show many things that contradict free-market orthodoxies, for example, the following factors do not cause unemployment: - Strict employment protection and labour market legislation - Generous unemployment benefits, provided they are not open-ended - High unionization, provided it is in a context of co-ordinated bargaining with employer organisations. Other relevant findings: - Minimum wage levels only affect youth unemployment when combined with high payroll tax, and do not affect adult unemployment - Poor education levels correlate strongly with unemployment - Historically, the amount of work to be done adjusts in line with the available labour supply, rendering attempts to control unemployment by adjusting working hours futile - A very clear influence on unemployment is demand, which is improved by wage increases. In conclusion, there is no clea",0

"Hi - couldn't find the battle on 'scots romans' until I googled 'caledonians 9th legion', which gave good background.

Also, re Lang Vei, I was looking for accounts that tell the story from the Vietnamese point of view - there's lots of stuff on various heroics by Americans, but nothing about how the battle was planned and executed by the Vietnamese. This would tie in nicely with your Night Combat, because clearly it was an attack designed to use the night as a tactical advantage. And the use of tanks was a fairly radical departure in that context. I'm guessing the US forces must have been aware that tanks were in the area, because there were around 100 LAWs rockets issued to the base, but the preparedness for armoured attack is also not really covered in the article except to say they 'weren't ready' for such an attack. This doesn't make much sense - if they were issued with a huge ile of anti-tank weapons then they *must* have expected such attacks?

"No indeterminates in the reals? Of course there are indeterminates in the real numbers - can you provide a complete representation in *any* number system for those numbers we call irrational? The answer is no. Even if it were possible for 0.999... to equal 1, it breaks the decimal system as it was intended since its invention. Do you agree that not all real numbers can be represented in a radix system? If yes, why would you insist on having a cauchy sequence define a number?  Just because you can list the first few terms says nothing about the limit. For example, you can provide a Cauchy sequence that 'represents' pi but you cannot find its limit. There are several contradictions in this branch of 'analysis' - All Cauchy sequences must have limits but you cannot find the actual limit of 'most' Cauchy sequences that represent the majority of real numbers you cannot represent completely.

", 27 November 2005 (UTC)  But in this instance it's the insistence that psychiatry is a legitimate branch of medicine and that all mental illness can be boiled down to brain chemicals gone awry that allows us to even *have* mental hygiene laws.  You know what I wish psychiatrists would work on?  Practical short-term solutions to alleviate suffering.  I wish psychiatrists could make people comfortable when they're in an emotional crisis and need to figure out what's going wrong in their lives.  There's certainly a need for that kind of assistance.

The article is edited and watched closely now. Are the only recent edits those three attempted additions to the Barack Obama article? Hardly a high crime it seems to me.

""" This is an interesting discussion with good points made by all. I can add a little bit that might be helpful. As mentioned by the editors above the dictionay definition and a legal definition are not the same and one state's legal definition might be different from another's. So why not say this in the article. What definition a reader needs or wants depends on their purpose. For example, if a young person is reading a book meant for older persons and comes across the word adultery, his needs will be far different than those of a lawyer who's client walks in and says, """"They charged me with 'adultery'; what's that?"""" In the first case the reader might need nothing more than a dictionary definition (or perhaps a little more, particularly that it is rare for someone to go to jail for it), and in the second case, the lawyer will want to explain all the elements of the crime (each thing that must be proved by the government in order to find someone guilty, including that it was done knowingly, etc.). The beginning could say: """"Adultery, in some jurisdictions a crime or a tort (a civil wrong) is generally defined as (insert dictionary definition). However in the legal context of a person actually being charged with adultery as a crime or cited as a grounds for a divorce or other lawsuit, a more precise definition would be required. The term adultery usually refers to the rarely prosecuted common law or statutory crime relating to having extra-marital relations, but usually in an informal or literary context not in a legal context. In ordinary usage the vagueness of the term is not a hindrance to communication, as the scope of the term is understood to change from context to context, some requiring more specifics than others. In a legal sense, residents of the United States, for example, understand that such laws differ from state to state, and even from time to time as laws are changed, and thus any legal use of the term is understood to require new research practically any time it comes up.""""

"""    Hello Tony  Yes, Wikipedia has a definition of """"short film."""" A prime thing re """"video short"""" though is that enormously more people use video for productions than film. Even bigtime movies are now partly made with video, not film. Things we see on the I'net are video - 99% of what we see on YouTube is produced in video, not film. I mentioned before some stuff I'd written re """"video short"""" - haven't sent it, but here it is. This will broaden perspective on present-day short videos:  • Video short  Video shorts are typically 3 to 15 minutes long, usually professionally or semi-professionally made. Video shorts commenced in the 1960s - many for business, education, documentaries, and TV news, also for video competitions. Video shorts are computer edited. Corporations produce video shorts to let people know about the essence of their products. Online businesses have started moving ahead with video shorts, not just with commercials but also for specific products and services. The shorts can also be promotional and educational.   There is a difference between video shorts and video clips. Scenes are usually shot better for video shorts than for video clips; clips are usually by amateurs. Cameras are often hand-held when shooting clips, making scenes bounce around; locations usually aren’t bouncing around though. For video shorts, skilled camera people often use a tripod with a dolly, or a Steadicam, to smoothly move the camcorder closer to subjects for steady images. On the other hand, people making video clips usually get closer or farther from what they’re shooting by “zooming” in and out rather than moving the camera closer to or farther from main subjects.  Corporations now produce video shorts for their websites. People usually prefer to watch videos about companies rather than just read about them. Of course, videos raise the number of people going to websites. TV stations, as well as national networks and websites, also produce video shorts for broadcast and for the Internet. Video shorts tend to be more serious than video clips. Also, carefully produced music videos are video shorts, not video clips.  A chief value of short videos (video shorts and video clips) is that people generally prefer not to watch long videos on the Internet. Shorts effectively convey essentials of products, services and happenings, etc. Long videos and movies, on the other hand, are typically watched on TV and DVDs. Video shorts on the I’net show issues, products, and happenings, also views of past, present and future. Video clips typically show brief events, occurrences and funny things. Both video shorts and video clips, being relatively short, often expand knowledge of things beyond text.  • Video clips -  (Wikipedia now has this definition)  In comparison, “video clips” are often relatively amateurish. The term “video short” came out before “video clip.” A video clip is defined as “a short clip of video recording.” Clips sometimes show surprising events - unexpected happenings and consequences, but they are generally informal. Video clips are primarily viewed on the Internet.  Video shorts became common in the 1970s and were usually professionally made. Video clips took off in 2005, mostly on YouTube. Most of what’s on YouTube are clips made by amateurs. Some clips are portions of relatively long productions - short extracts from movies or television programs, often funny happenings and events. Video clips are generally “non-serious.” Most clips are made by amateurs - about 80% of what’s on YouTube are made by amateurs.  Very much look forward to your response on this. I think """"video short"""" is unquestionably a real """"category"""" that needs to be known/accepted/used. Thank you much.  Mike Cady     """,0

""" The Burke Group In response,  I never provided where he went to school.   I added  he is a J.D.    RAther than delete he is a J.D. (Juris Doctor)  then refer to him as Dr.  David Burke?  A J.D. is a Doctor of Jurisprudence same as a Ph.D.   Why do you allow personal information that's good for you but not for others who might be interested in knowing more?  He was important enough to post an article so why do you think any reader will be satisfied with a sum total of data saying  he owns a rental property in Agoura Hills with a meaningless political contribution?  The property posted is a rental  where he no longer lives and maybe never did.   How is that useful in an article about organized labour? You said it yourself the article should be about the company.  But in actual fact, he IS the company.    He's a flight instructor whom I know from our FBO (Flight Base Operation).  Lots of people know him.   He hasn't contributed to Republicans for years.  Look at the site you  provided!!  Last one was 2004.  Why continue to keep outdated useless information?  The article cited by Dr. John Logan, a very learned fellow, contains some useful info but also contains factually incorrect information. Even he can make mistakes.   I am a lawyer and Logan is a British economist, and may understand E.U. law but does not understand U.S. labor law.  Just because he writes about it does not mean he understands it.  There is NO newspaper article about CDN that says employees were awarded from the Court of Appeals.  He wrote incorrectly.    The citation provided which corrects his article  is  from the court dockets.  Which is a better citation?    I provided the citation from  the law firm that WON the civil case against CDN!!   I removed nothing  about the case itself.... only corrected the information in such a way that the non legal lay person could understand the fundamental differences between NLRB law and DOL law and civil actions filed with the District Courts.   What John Logan wrote that you cite is liking saying someone was cited by the F.A.A. but tried at the D.M.V.!!!  Are you British?  F.A.A. is Federal Aviation Admin. and D.M.V. is Dept. of Motor Vehicles.  They are not related anymore than NLRB is to District Court or civil cases..   Burke works in NLRB jurisdiction and the case you cite is a Civil Action in District Courts not related.    If you want CDN  discussed,  first part is fine but the civil action is not.  there should be another topic developed in wikipedia for CDN.    Logan's article  used as a citation  lacks any credible legal citation connecting Burke to the civil case.   Only a legal citation should be used.   There are none available.    DJB is a very well known person and lots of lawyers both company and union know him. No matter which side of the aisle...this information is flawed.    If you are going to discuss legal issues then get them right.  Am I being picky?  Yes.  Inside the law you can't just throw something at the ceiling and hope it sticks.   Deleting FACTS for FICTION is beneath the dignity of what Wikipedia has strived to promote.    Why do you say the article contains everything anyone needs to know to justify deleting contributions?   How is that possible when Wikipedia is an opened forum for knowledgeable people to build and add more?  You think the sum total for the reader should be that Burke owns a rental property in Agoura HIlls?  How is that related to THe Burke Group?

"""#2 Richard 20:53 20FebYeah, so the problem as I see it, is that we still don't have a good number for how many Germans died in Poland except that maybe (according to http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=260621074909720), the max is 1 million (a number that is a little too """"round"""" for my liking).Richard, you reading very carelessly. This is 1.1 in total not round million. Or do you ridicule the estimations at start? The """"a million"""" is because more easy was to estimate the total and the 1946-1950 loses from obvious reasons. Nobody can know exact number of deaths during flight, there was complete chaos. Who died was just buried on spot at road. Some graves disappeared just because were provisionally marked only. I remember some graves of even Polish soldiers on an edge of forest which disappeared in time. The wooden crosses just disintegrated. You do not believe because you are too young.In any event, if you look at the numbers provided in Demographic estimates of the German exodus from Eastern Europe, you see 1,225,000 deaths in the """"Eastern German territories"""" and 263,000 in Poland for a total of 1,488,000 deaths which differs from Nitschke's estimates by about 500,000.The 500.000 is big number, too big. I would believe in accuracy if the difference would be 100.000. But Nitschke could not count the East lost Polish teritories Kresy . Any way my goal is to separate the Flight number from Expulsion number.If you take this downward revision of 500,000 and add it to the downward revision of 150,000 or so that the joint commission of Czech and German historians proposed, you can see how the ZgV's numbers of 2 million could be revised downards to 1 - 1.2 million which is what I believe Overmans is proposing. I don't understand the 500,000 figure yet. This counting I do not understand. You want see the most exact total number of deaths I suppose. What I attempt is to prevent such quacking like “Poland,…murdered millions of Germans.”. We have to assume that same individuals can be handicapped and can not read and write correctly and the info should be VERY simple.What I'm still looking for is some indication of whether Nitschke, Haar and Overmans are widely accepted as right or if they are still the minority challenging the established majority opinion. In my opinion you contradict yourself. You always propagated multipoint POV. I always propagate logic and comparison. We can come closer to truth only by deduction and investigation. There will be always “minority challenging the established majority opinion” as you say. Beside not always majority is right, as you know Hitler was elected and supported by majority.It would help if we could get some quotes that evaluate the work of these historians and puts them in context of the overall consensus of academic opinion.If you have some idea how to do it I would try. From my experience in my professional field it is really difficult to get clue who of the researches is good and who barely satisfactory. You need to be professional yourself. Regularly scientific authors do not attack openly the opponent in scientific journals. They rather systematically attack opponent theories in extend period of time. In historical journals can be the same. Maybe you understand in this context that the academic opinion is not easy to grasp. Beside, quite often you need to know the scientists personal animosities. Some Wiki editor can be smarter then me and get multi pro and contra from popular press article on internet. Personally I do not trust popular newspapers there is too many errors and politic manipulations. I would consider “Google” type search in this point as waist of time. """,0

There is a [Verstappen#Nationality 2|discussion] over the matter and the editor does not seem to believe that the F1 Driver Infobox nationality field only lists racing nationality. They have asked me for a link to the discussion that achieved that consensus. This practice has been in use for a very long time, in any case much longer than I have been around. I therefore don't know where to search for it. I have found a few discussion over driver nationality in the WikiProject's archives but nothing satisfying.

"You added it again and I've deleted it again from punk rock. You need to be aware of three things—and it would help if you'd actually read the rest of the section where you've been trying to make your addition:The entire section focuses on the emergence of scenes in countries around the world in 1977 and 1978. Bands from the 1980s aren't discussed for any country. It's not appropriate to discuss those later Brazilian bands here. Use the new Punk in Brazil article Wwwhatsup created for that.The section introduces the names of no more than three bands per country (France's Stinky Toys are discussed earlier in the article); in many cases, just two. You wanted to add fourteen for Brazil. You should be able to understand how inappropriate that is. We're just focusing in this section on the most important, earliest punk bands in each country.Every single claim in the section is is followed by a citation, referencing one or more reliable sources. That's how we know we can trust the information there. You haven't provided a single source. You've listed some band names from the late 1970s. Take a look at the article List of Brazilian punk and hardcore groups. That mentions a mostly different set of Brazilian punk bands from the 1970s. Without proper references, how can we trust that we're actually naming the most important bands? Please read the Wikipedia policy on WP:Verifiability.Sofeel free to go to work on Punk in Brazil. As it's a new article, you'll have a free hand there. But punk rock is a Featured Article, and there's no way the information you keep adding is going to be allowed to stay. If you can trim down the list of most important 1970s Brazilian bands to two or three and identify sources that discuss their importance, we'll be happy to mention them in the article. Best, Dan.—",0

"Samantha Harrison Hi. I've reverted some of your edits on the article Samantha Harrison again, because I simply can't find any references for them.You're new here, so I'll explain simply: for every article, especially for articles about living people, you need to provide a source for a stated fact. Put it another way - if Samantha Harrison came along to her own Wikipedia article and found something on it not to be true about her, we could get into a lot of trouble (see libel). If we have referenced that fact from another reliable source (say, a newspaper article or a website), then we are not to blame for any untrue information because it verified from another source (even if the source is untrue about the fact).Samantha being a member of the Southern Districts Hockey Club is a fact, and even though it was not referenced by you, a quick Google search by me took me to a New Zealand Herald article stating her to be so, so I added that article as a reference to the fact. However, other facts added do not return anything useful for a reference, so we can't state them - I can't find anything about going to Cambridge, or her parents' divorce (which the latter is also irrelavent information).If you can find a source, feel free to re-add the information with the source.

"""MAGHASITO 2USer:Maghasito try to spread of pseudo science, the so-called Hungarian Turanism , which is now a politically motivated chauvinist pseudo-science from the 19th century and a core agenda of far right Jobbik party and ww2 nazi Arrow Cross Party . There are not a single contemporary scholar (academics university professors) linguistics, historian, population geneticist on this planet, who support that fantasy theory. Wikikpedia is a free encyclopedia, however it is not the place of the popularization of pseudo-scientific politically-motivated fantastic nonsenses. The best option would be the permanent ban of Maghasito. Thank you! I believe that he is from a worker class family (as most of the Turanist believers), he migrated to UK or USA as a an economic-refugee due to the economic crisis. Many of this turanist boys read the esoteric pseudo-scientific  books of the so-called self-appointed turanist """"shaman-scholars"""". These shaman """"scholars"""" are usually electricians, blacksmiths, masons, car-mechanic in the real life, so they have no any university degrees. These less educated worker-class boys admired them as knowledgeable expert. Just read our discussions in the talkpage of Hungarian turanism: Forexample he consider Ferenc Zajti (shaman-scholar) as one of the greatest historian, Zajti was who invented the theory of Parthian - Hungarian Jesus. (according to Zajti Jesus Christ was not a Jew but a proto-Hungarian). These turan-believer-boys are often racist, they consider the Indo-Europeans and Semitic people and their culture as inferior and subhuman who created a very low primitive culture, and they consider the culture and race of Central Asian nomadic Turkic people as superior culture and race.

"""=Removal from Anti-Semetic category===Mel Gibson is Only HumanWhile Mr. Gibson did make wrong, anti-semetic comments, he did so drunk, and he does not speak openly about any kind of anti-semetic views when sober. He also does not advocate his views or pursues them past a drunken rant. I think he needs to be removed from wikipedia's Anti-Semetic category. What do you guys think. He's an adult. The law doesn't make a distinction betwen words & acts said and committed when drunk and when sober; neither should we. He is quoted on a police report as making remarks that are undeniably anti semitic. Therefore, he is anti-semitic.  Like all material here, just provide sources saying that Gibson is anti-semetic and you can add it in. Thanks Umm, the NYT quotes him as making comments about the """"fucking jews"""". Is this not a sufficient source for you?  In which case, this little ditty from the article also seems to help...a prominent jewish leader calling him an anti-semite: In response, Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League, who was one of The Passion'''s most vocal critics, released a statement saying that Gibson's apology was """"unremorseful and insufficient"""" and that the group hoped that """"Hollywood now would realize the bigot in their midst and that they will distance themselves from this anti-Semite."""" Gibson said that he has disgraced himself and his family and he is sorry for what he did. What more do does Foxman want? Yes, and hollywood has such high standards to hold up...this is the kind of ammunition Foxman craved as soon as he started criticizing the Passion. I'm not anti-semetic in anyway, and Gibson SHOULD be ashamed. I just don't like people being unfair. I also think the mugshot is unfair and I will be changing it. I agree that the mugshot may be unfair as a primary image for this article. but it should be included near the discussion of this incident.  The ADL has been sued for defamation for unfairly accusing people of anti-Semitism before and has been mired in a number of controversies. I would hardly consider them a reliable source.  Yeah, like George Bush might get drunk and suddenly shout out """"I love Islam!"""" because when you're drunk you typically say the opposite of what you believe?  It's funny to read the arguments here about if Mr. Gibson is anti-Semitic or not given the known views of his """"Traditionalist"""" Catholic church. Clearly he is anti-Semitic, and in another time, he would probably say so """"proudly"""". Call a spade a spade, if it quacks, it’s a duck. Mel Gibson is anti-Semitic. Can there really be any question among intelligent people? And if this is so, than clearly it has a place in the article.  Please don't insult us with your damned sneering arrogance, Jake B.  Or some of us may argue that there is no question amongst """"intelligent people"""" that many Israelis and right-leaning Jews amongst the diaspora are racists and gentile haters who campaign in a McCarthyist style (just look at the reaction to this case - utterly hysterical).  I tell you what: I can provide more evidence to support my assertion than you can to support yours (cf ADL). And by the way, according to the ADL every single gentile in the world who isn't an Israel supporter is a Jew hater and racist who should be condemned and ostracised, so quoting one of the leaders is like quoting Hitler in an article on Jews.  Many gentiles see the ADL as nasty, racist and very dangerous.  And by the way, compare Gibson's comments with some of those posted by Jews on the Ha'aretz online forums: he's positively liberal compared to them (I quote from recent posts:  .....99.99% of Arabs are terrorists [does this one sound familiar?].....let's just nuke them all and stop wasting our soldiers' lives.....you can't trust Muslims to hold to peace.....Mel Gibson is a Nazi.....''etc etc ad infinitum, plus hundreds of comments saying the civilians of the Qana massacre got what they deserved.

"First Lady Michelle Obama quotes on American Sniper ===  The number-one movie in America right now is a complex, emotional depiction of a veteran and his family.  And I had a chance to see “American Sniper” this week on that long flight we took – (laughter)  and while I know there have been critics, I felt that, more often than not, this film touches on many of the emotions and experiences that I’ve heard firsthand from military families over these past few years.   Now, I’m not going to spoil it for anyone who hasn’t seen it, but this movie reflects those wrenching stories that I’ve heard  the complex journeys that our men and women in uniform endure.  The complicated moral decisions they are tasked with every day.  The stresses of balancing love of family with a love of country.  And the challenges of transitioning back home to their next mission in life.   And here’s why a movie like this is important:  see, the vast majority of Americans will never see these stories.  They will never grasp these issues on an emotional level without portrayals like this.  Like I said, I’m lucky -– I have had the   chance to visit our wounded warriors at Walter Reed, go to base after base.  I’ve been able to sit down with groups of caregivers and military spouses and hear about their struggles and their triumphs.   And let me tell you, those experiences have changed me.  They have changed me.  They’ve made me want to do everything I can to support our troops, veterans and their families.  But for all those folks in America who don’t have these kinds of opportunities, films and TV are often the best way we have to share those stories.''  http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/30/remarks-first-lady-got-your-six-screenwriters-event-conversation-power-t  http://variety.com/2015/film/news/first-lady-michelle-obama-offers-praise-for-american-sniper-1201419881/  Perhaps some of these quotes should be used in the article. -     =",0

"""  == Alleged Original Research ==  I have added back a load of content that was removed supposedly under the reasoning that it was """"original research"""". First, there was reliably sourced content that was removed. The """"Changes in direction"""" section was already reliably sourced as were the quotes. How that falls under original research I'll never know. The show underwent some major changes and to omit that one of the main characters was killed off makes no sense whatsoever. The fact that two of the main stars, John Amos and Esther Rolle, publicly complained about the series and ultimately left because of it also doesn't fall under OR. This was covered by the media as evidenced by the sources that were present. If someone had a problem with Ebony and The LA Times being reliable sources, they should have dropped a note here instead of removing a shit ton of content that someone took the time to write (not me) and another person (me) took the time to source. Original research isn't including details about the work, it's drawing your own conclusions based on your own research. In television show articles, we can use the work itself as a source for the actual details of the show. Once the writing start veering off into overly detailed garbage, that's when the OR police can come out. Works of fiction should have some details about production, ratings, show changes, etc. If not, all we have is an article that say a show aired and some people were in it. It took me all of 20 minutes to find sources for the majority of the removed content - none of it was contentious nor was it OR which means it should not have been removed. Ironically, actual original research about the stupid opening titles was left in.  """,1

""" You are absolutely right. This has been discussed before. And the conclusion was to include both nationalities. And like I said above an IP user was edit warring over his nationality. It wasn't fair to revert him back as the previous consensus supported included both nationalities.

So, instead, I decided to start a new discussion to arrive at a cleared consensus.That said, now I too believe that it's reasonable to mention his nationality as dutch per this article and above rationales.

"""Yeah, this is pretty much how I see you. I can tell the difference between an editor or admin """"out to get me,"""" a few are on occasion, maybe, and one who is simply dealing with matters as they appear at the moment. Often what I do can be hard to understand; if I'm brief, it's rejected as incoherent, if I explain thoroughly, it's tl;dr. And to explain with the exact balance of brevity and detail is difficult and often time-consuming; that is the best of writing, and it's hard to come by. One of my friends who, in the past, has written on the same topics as I do, but who is far more brief, has said that, sure, he's brief, but I'm more thorough, and it takes him three times as long to write his brief summary (which, I'd say, is typically excellent) as it takes me to write my tome.) Ideally, it takes all kinds to write and edit an encyclopedia; writers *often* are too wordy, besides having points of view, making mistakes, and failing to reference claims, because they are writing from personal knowledge, and that's why they need editors, in real life as well as on Wikipedia. Editors and writers, real-world, are famous for conflict.On-line interaction is also famous for leading to flame wars, because of the absence of all the cues that allow truly high-bandwidth communication in person, mostly visual: this can't be stuffed into the very narrow channel of text, not even close (much more than a thousand times as much information per second). I've been """"conferencing"""" on-line since the mid-1980s, and it was obvious then. If there is rapport failure, text may be interpreted through a hostile filter; hostile or false meanings can be seen in the text, instead of alternate true or at least neutral meanings. Woonpton has done some reading in my history, and doesn't understand what she read (I think it's she). Others have done the same. If you look at Jehochman's warning to me that was the basis for my block last year, you could see a similarity with Woonpton's conclusions. Iridescent didn't make that the basis of the block, but was clearly thinking the like of it in discussions around the block on her Talk page. I went to the trouble of working it out with Jehochman, first with a userspace self-RfC (an new process, I must say, that should be more used by editors with a complaint about how they have been treated, it was designed to be minimally disruptive; had I been as accused, I'd have been so advised, and I would not have been able to use the self-RfC for anything else), then by approaching Jehochman directly, and, out of that, a very solid working relationship has been formed. it was good even before we met in person. I never did address it with Iridescent, it seemed moot by the time I'd have been ready. Maybe someday. Thanks for dropping by, make yourself at home.

The article retains a neutral point of view on what data we present, since readers may be just as interested in the collective value of the whole Batman franchise as opposed to just one series in it; on the other hand, they must just be interested in the Nolan series. Either way it doesn't matter because both sets of data are given. Likewise with the Middle Earth films, the reader has access to how much the franchise has earned as a whole, how much the Jackson series has earned as a whole, and how much just the LOTR trilogy within the Jackson series has earned as a whole.

Mr. Ghorum, (Madison misspelled the name - the person is actually Nathanial Gorham) states that if the words stand (the words being """"emit bills of credit"""") that """"they may suggest and lead to the measure"""" with the measure being printing legal tender paper money. To be ABSOLUTELY clear, this vote denied Congress the power to """"emit"""" per money, and strikes at the core of arguments in favor of paper money, because Congress cannot make paper money a legal tender because the power to print paper money was REMOVED from Congress. If Congress cannot even print paper money, how can it make it legal tender?In Federalist 44 - Madison states The extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure to every citizen, in proportion to his love of justice and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity. The loss which America has sustained since the peace, from the pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence between man and man, on the necessary confidence in the public councils, on the industry and morals of the people, and on the character of republican government, constitutes an enormous debt against the States chargeable with this unadvised measure, which must long remain unsatisfied; or rather an accumulation of guilt, which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice on the altar of justice, of the power which has been the instrument of it.From Craig v Misouri The whole was intended to exclude everything from use as a circulating medium except gold and silver''', and to give to the United States the exclusive control over the coining and valuing of the metallic medium.

""" call """"current"""" discussion; that is, our discussion of the big changes you started here just about 30 days ago.  It will be hard to anyone coming to the discussion at this point to know much of what we're talking about with this much removed.  I know, but then not much was being removed.  But I've put back October. Cultural depictions of Johannes Gutenberg I've started an approach that may apply to Wikipedia's Core Biography articles: creating a branching list page based on in popular culture information.  I started that last year while I raised Joan of Arc to featured article when I created Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc, which has become a featured list.  Recently I also created Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great out of material that had been deleted from the biography article.  Since cultural references sometimes get deleted without discussion, I'd like to suggest this approach as a model for the editors here.  Regards, ''' Clean-up and changes by Mukerjee Oct 18A number of changes were made and the article was considerably cleaned up onOct 18: The claims of printing in Korea and China, largely unreferenced were referenced with extensive quotations The Biography section which was only a paragraph with other fragments scattered elsewhere was cleaned up (but still needs work).  The contributions of Gutenberg as the father of the printing press and a leading catalyst of the Renaissance have been under challenge from a number of quarters, this was presented with documentation The possibility that East-West traffic over the two preceding centuries of the Mongol Empire may have led to some knowledge in Europe of movable type  was introduced  A number of sentences and structures (such as the unwieldy initial paragraphs) were copyedited ruthlessly, merged with other fragments, and cleaned up. User Dicklyon reverts with the comment: too much of a change to do without discussion. This is not a criteria in Wikipedia, where ruthless editing is consistentlyencouraged. Please justify in what way these changes are inappropriate and merge them byputting in extensive work instead of just a revert. I am reverting back to the new version which certainly reads better, and has far better referencing and citations than the present version.  Please giveyour reasons here; please do not blindly revert; edit''' the text to merge the elements you don't agree with.   It does not make sense to keepthe older inferior version that people are working with still.   Such an extensive edit that throws out the stable work of many editors over many months, with no chance for incremental review and collaboration, is just too disruptive and disrespectful, in my opinion.  But I'll let someone else decide now whether to revert you again.  I recommend a revert, followed by you re-integrating changes piece by piece, with time between for reactions and negotiations.  p.s. We don't need weasle words in the lead.  If it is verfiably true that """"Even within Europe, there are those who claim that Laurens Janszoon Coster of Holland may have used movable types earlier,"""" then you have to say WHO makes such a claim, and give a verifiable reference for it.  The things I have read about Coster did NOT say that anyone actually claims or believes that, only that it was a local legend for a while.  I understand your angst at having many microscopic changes gone.  But the so-called """"stable"""" version read rather poorly, and at least the English and the flow is a lot cleaner.  There were repeated references (e.g. two consecutive parags referred to his family in Biog; the A&E; award had two references, etc), there were poor constructs,and of course, the referencing was admittedly poor.  So please try to look at the whole picture.  Wikipedia says it right up front - edit the page only if you don't mind others """"ruthlessly"""" editing your text. As for the weasel word issue, this is what the current version reads (pls see the Biography section) - these were edits that were made before your comment here:His business partner was Johann Fust who was more of a banker than a printer, but a 1568 history by Hadrianus Junius of Holland claims that the basic idea of the movable type came to Gutenberg from Laurens Janszoon Coster via Fust, who was apprenticed to Coster around 1940 and may have brought some of his equipment to Mainz",0

"""  == Cancer and Chinese Medicine  ==  Chinese medicine contains a number of methods for dealing with cancer, including acupuncture and herbal medicine. There is no mention of Chinese medicine in this article. Chinese medicine can help to reduce pain suffered by cancer victims, and in some cases may help to prolong lives of cancer patients. Chinese medicine may further be used to help counteract the effects of radiation and chemotherapy.  There are sufficient sources for these therapies, primarily from Bob Flaws at Blue Poppy Press, as well as many books published in China in English and in Chinese. A good number of these therapies have been researched in China, although the results of that research for the most part has not been translated into English.  Proposed Entry for Cancer and Chinese Medicine  Cancer and Chinese Medicine   Chinese medicine offers some hope and much relief to those who suffer from cancer of many different types. This may be news to many who live in the west.   A number of ancient herbal formulas may help to address pain caused by cancer, while new formulae may help to relieve the side - effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatments.   Acupuncture treatments may also help deal with cancer, especially stomach cancer. There are specific acupoints which focus in on stomach cancer.   Chinese medicine is well-suited to address the following types of cancer:   Lung cancer   Mammary / Breast cancer   Esophagal (throat) cancer   Nasal cancer   Stomach cancer   Pancreatic cancer   Prostate cancer   Ovarian cancer, ovarian cysts, uterine cancer.   Bladder cancer   Liver cancer   Leukemia   Skin cancer   Brain cancer   Although Chinese medicine does not """"cure"""" cancer, Chinese medicine is capable of relieving pain related to cancer, reducing the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation and extending life expectancy for those diagnosed with cancer.  1.

This particular edit did not make any improvements; it did not fix anything; it merely constituted a technical interpretation of an editing guideline (not even a policy).  One or two such edits don't make much difference, but I wanted to point this out to you just in case you decide to do it systematically, in which case it would be a waste of everyone's time (including yours) indeed.  Hence my comment (and it is in """"so many words"""" simply because I have a propensity to blabber).  :As for the literal interpretation of the guidelines, please note that their intent is usually to prevent misunderstandings and useless reverts (like ours).  In general sense (not just within this guideline), when something is not broken, it is counterproductive to """"fix"""" it.  This is why we never change British spellings to American and vice versa, switch between different date formats, or between link styles unless something obviously needs fixing or otherwise creates problems.  With Turan, no problem existed before your edit, no problem was solved during your edit, and no problem appeared after your edit.  All in all, your edit was pointless.  In such cases it is always best to stick with what's already in place, especially because there just might be other reasons why the original contrubitor chose one style over another; reasons you might not be aware of.  In case of Turan, for example, piped link style is typical in vast majority of articles about the Russian inhabited localities.  With your desire to achieve universal consistency, surely there should be some appeal in preserving the consistency which is already in place?  Cheers,— • ; August 10, 2010; 18:16 (UTC)""",0

""" North Korea actually gained approximately 230 km² from China in the 1962 treaty. And here's a 19th century book by Chong Yagyong, titled """"Korea's Northern Border Reigion"""" (in a Korean sourcebook compilation translated by Peter Hacksoo Lee): A long time ago, the area north of the Tumen River was the land of the Su-shen people. It has not been under our control since the time of the Three Han. The ''southern slopes of Mount Changbaek, where both the Tumen and Yalu rivers have their headwaters, lay within our territory, but the winding ridges and layers of peaks make the exact location of the border unclear. However, Emperor K'ang-hsi, in the final years of his reign [1662-1722], ordered Area Commander Wu-la (Wu-la ts'ung-kuan) Muk'eteng to delineate the border and erect a stone boundary marker. As a result, the border between those two rivers is clear as well. [emphasis mine]Here's another study of the US-North Korea border in 1962, by the US Dept of State, which makes no mention of North Korea owning the entire mountain.  And another, which says that China actually made concessions to NK on the border in 1962 . The only sources that seem to claim that Korea once owned the entire place are some recent tabloid news articles that protest China conducting activities on its own side of the border, and of course, a few ultranationalist sites, but please, enlighten me if you can provide other reliable sources as well. On another rather amusing note, it does seem my userboxes are being quite effective experiment in showing which users are capable of  judging others by the content their edits, and which prefer to judge a book by it's cover and lash out emotionally.  should be made in a new section on the talk page. No further edits should be made to this section. The result of the debate was no move.  ' Requested moveChonji → Tianchi – The name was unilaterally moved from Tianchi to Chonji without concensus, for POV reasons (cited in move and talk page), such as that it should be Korean (it's on the border between China and Korea). Another reason cited was that the name of the Baekdu Mountain page is Korean as well. However, a Google search shows nearly 30,000 hits for Tianchi, and and less than 1,000 each for Chonji and Cheonji. That's two orders of magnitude in difference. (the preceding was quoted by Yuje)  SurveyAdd """"* Support"""" or """"* Oppose"""" followed by a brief explanation, then sign your opinion with ~~~~ Support for the most common name. Searches for """"Chonji"""" for all the most popular search engines combined give less than a thousand hits. Search on Google scholar shows only 2 uses of the name """"Chonji"""" for the lake. The use of Chonji as a clear common name doesn't apply because it's not common.  Support — per Yuje.  Naming conventions gives preference to the more popular name. Oppose per Visviva and my previous comments. Like I said before, we need to use the most common name that is the clearest because """"Tianchi"""" is a name for many other places in China.  As shown, Chonji is nowhere near common. Chonji barely shows up any hits, therefore isn't a viable alternative for a clear alternative name.  Oppose Look at my reason below.  Comment:  The proposition seems to be flawed...  Given that Tianchi is now an article on the lake in Urumqi, if this article is moved it would need to go somewhere else; perhaps Tianchi (Changbaishan) or even (heh heh) Tianchi (Paektusan), but then again maybe Tianchi (Jilin)... if we must'' have a straw poll, it would be helpful to know what the full suggested title is.    Comment''': The issue you brought up is a legitimate one and shouldn't be ignored. Thus perhaps Tianchi could be a disambiguation page, or this page could be moved back to the original and there could be a Tianchi (disambiguation) page. Either one is a reasonable alterna",0

"""== Teh Examples ==  I am puting this here because I really do not want to be blamed for doing what needs to be done. I am gonna set off an limb and say that over 90% of the """"examples"""" are crap tacked on to be tacked on.  In the Tales from the Crypt spin-off movie Bordello of Blood, one of the main characters says at one point """"I feel like I'm in a bad episode of Tales from the Crypt.""""   Is idiotic, they are ADVERTISING their FRANCHISE How hard is it to understand that, the actor didn't say """"I AM in a episode of TFTC"""" he referenced it saying """"It feels LIKE I am"""" If he said """"It feels like I am in a horror film"""" you wouldn't jump on it being meta-reference... well probally would. This is about DELIBRATLY turning away from the stage and adressing the audiance / cameramen. I will accept Acknowledging the audiances existance, but not 'in this episode they may have done something that looked like this'.  You have to realize also that reference to past films is not Meta Reference. It is once again, advertisment. So in the sequal of Grimlins they held up Grimlins One, guess what, they are filming Grimlins 2 SO he was not aware of being an actor in a production.  Finally in the TV Show section it looks like you all forget that in TV Land time goes on. Just because the guy says something that happened in a previous episode does not mean that he watches the show. And in my example, I understand that you look at it like """"ohh, it was in the show before. lets go spam meta-reference""""  """"Eric Cartman suggests a storyline feature 'Crab People'. This is immediately derided as a ludicrous and implausible idea for a television show. 'Crab People' were themselves featured in a previous South Park episode.""""    Some of the entries are rather, stupid. Implying that the show sucks and because they can do nothing and say nothing for the length of the show META-REFERENCE!!!!  """"On SpongeBob SquarePants, certain characters (usually Squidward Tentacles) often mention things going on for 11 minutes, the usual length for a regular episode.""""    And some entries are clearly just commical remarks put in by the writer but not having the characters REALIZE they are fictional.  """"Futurama features an episode in which, faced with the prospect of risking her and Fry's lives to save Bender, Leela exclaims, """"It's not an easy decision. If only we had two or three minutes to think about it!"""" The show then breaks for commercials.""""    Personally allowing a TV Show section is the worst idea there is. EVERY show eventually has that little thing that writters toss in there. But if you are gonna put in an example based off of a TV show, the TV Show should have an example for every 5 episodes at least.  """,0

"""  kinda.  I'll partially reverse that, for three reasons.  The main one stems from the argument I'm having on Wrestlemania XXVIII vis-a-vis the Daniel Bryan cash-in and the concept that appears to be getting rammed down my throat of WP:Crystal, even though I have demonstrated that not to be the case over there.  If putting Bryan, by the nature of the program and at this point and time, on the Mania XXVIII card is WP:Crystal, then the concept of the strippage and any Raw title match in Hampton, VA tomorrow night (7/25) is also, technically, WP:Crystal as well.This redoubles when you look at the second reason.  We now know that SOMETHING is going on between Punk and WWE, and that this grand angle is going a fairly new and viral direction.  Still, end of the day, we can't source that he's under contract, but they are keeping it well under wraps.The third reason is a timeline continuity-break in the storyline.  The best I can say (and what I posted today) is that the current title status is unknown.  Consider the following from the storyline:  The Board meeting which ended McMahon's tenure took place several hours before McMahon announced the tournament.  So, is the tournament valid?  Is the final valid?  Now, consider the timeline of the """"questionable decisions"""" involved.  Is the lifting of the suspension valid if the """"fire Cena"""" stipulation is not?  Is Cena the champ?  Is Punk the champ?  Is Alberto del Rio also #1 Contender on top of Senor Dinero el en Banco?  Is the Rey/Miz tournament final valid?  We have a storyline continuity break which probably will be addressed on the 7/25 RAW.  But, as of the moment, the entire current status is unknown.  Punk may well be entitled to this entire week as champion, or not even be entitled to a reign at all (though we do have official sourcing, as of the moment, to clear that entitlement for the moment)!

There are plenty in this country who get on with life and mind their own business, but they don't look good on MTV's Real World or mainstream media so they don't get noticed. Assholes are assholes no matter where they come from. That's a basic fact of life that IMO more people need to be aware of. I can think of a number of editors on here that I consider total assholes, and I have no idea where they come from (and frankly I don't care). Lumping things into country of origin (all Americans are assholes, all Italians are assholes) accomplishes nothing and gives the assholes cover that they might not otherwise have.",0

After the pogroms of 1955 and the general ethnic cleansing policies of the Kemalist state, there are perhaps 1000 Greeks or less left in Turkey, most of them in Istanbul. The Greeks did NOT ethnic cleanse the Turks. Turks are perhaps a hundred times more and they occupy a large portion of two prefectures (Rhodopi and Xanthi). Greece, contrary to acquis communautaire and because of strict adherence to the Lausanne treaty, still lets the mufti perform lots of administrative and judicial duties. This, along with continuous propaganda from the Turkish state (the books in minority schools come directly from Turkey!), has made the minority a time-bomb inside Greece, waiting to explode.  """,0

"""The term 'tense' would seem to be the least understood term in linguistics. It does not, and cannot, indicate the time setting of the verb because it only means something when compared to the time setting the verb relates to.  There are only two tenses, 'the past' and 'the non-past'. Tense is solely chosen by the speaker. Verbs relate to either 'the past' or the 'non-past'. This is solely determined from the context. (Perfect verbs relate to the time period that follows the one in which the actions or states occur. Imperfect verbs relate to the same time period.) The time periods 'past of the past' and 'past' occur in the 'past' time zone. The 'present' and 'future' time periods occur in the 'non-past' time zone.   If the tense matches the time zone, the verb is 'natural'. If they do not match, then the verb is 'unnatural'. Natural verbs can be taken at face value. Unnatural verbs require deeper analysis. An unnatural verb in the past tense is either hypothetical or is informing the listener that the speaker is less friendly than usual. An unnatural verb in the present tense informs the listener that the speaker is more friendly than usual.  In English teaching there is a structure described as a third conditional. All text books describe this as an hypothetical event in the past and all text books are wrong to do so. If the actions described by the verbs occur in the past of the past, then it is as likely that the condition has been met as it is that the condition in a first conditional (e.g. """"If it rains, we will get wet."""") will be met. Only third conditionals whose verbs relate to the non-past time zone are hypothetical.  That traditional grammar descriptions of tense are wrong can be easily seen from a line in a Bob Seger song, """"I wish I did not know now what I did not know then"""". Traditional grammar describes both verbs as being 'past simple'. Yet they cannot have the same description because they have different meanings. They are more correctly descibed as 'non-past simple in the past tense' and 'past simple in the past tense' respectively.   Mel Tisdale""",0

"""Doncram: I don't know if you think you're some sort of civil rights crusader here, or if you're trying to fight some sort of big injustice, but you have been going over and over and over and OVER with this crusade.  It's getting really tiresome.  I could say more here  a lot more  but I'm too angry to really articulate it.  You are wasting a lot of people's time going off on this stupid crusade, and meanwhile, your articles are suffering.  As an example: When I checked out Hill to Hill Bridge, a new article, I found that Bethlehem Waterworks was linked to it.  It's a National Historic Landmark, and when I read the article and noticed how short it was, I knew it was one of yours.  Here's one of the pearls of wisdom from it: """"(It) is a site significant for its age.""""  That doesn't give the reader any context.  Doing just a little bit of research  just reading the PDF online  would have produced some more interesting facts.  It was the first municipal pumping system that provided drinking and washing water anywhere in the American colonies.  The Moravians who founded Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in 1741 had a village of several hundred people in 1750, and since they were spending so much time and effort hauling water up from the creek, they contracted with a local carpenter/millwright to build a water works.  It was an ingenious system inspired by European technology.  Yet the reader of the Wikipedia article on this topic wouldn't realize this  all they'd know is that it's a site historic for its age, and it's on the banks of a creek.  I guess I'm seeing two different problems here: First, you're spending a lot of time advocating on behalf of a banned user who has been known to willfully damage the encyclopedia by inserting false, misleading, and unreferenced content.  Despite everyone's attempts to convince you that there's a reason for the ban, and that the banned user(s) should appeal for themselves to resolve the ban, you keep pressing on with this crusade.  Despite everyone's attempts to convince you to let the matter drop, you keep on railing against the administrators involved.  The second major problem, which is unrelated, is that you've been creating a lot of short stubby NRHP articles that have no context and don't provide any useful information for the reader.  """"The houses are, indisputably, houses."""" is NOT educational.  I don't know how many two-sentence stubs you've created that don't have context, but I can only guess at how many of those articles someone else is going to have to come back and clean up.

On the other hand it is also true - as implied in the quote - that there may be many millions of USD (it is a big economy) worth of bitcoins present today in Russia on computers owned by Russians since they bought them from and paid for them in Russian Roubles on exchanges accessible to them outside Russia - and that this practice most probably would continue with and equivalent increase in the number and value of bitcoins inside Russia. If the article would have continued to state in two sourced instances only that bitcoin is illegal in Russia, it would have projected the wrong impression that there are no bitcoins in Russia and that bitcoin plays absolutely no role in the Russian economy. I do agree that the section in question deals with the legal status of bitcoin in a country. Embellishing the section with reality improves the article.",0

Was mir hauptsächlich nicht an deiner Version gefällt, ist, dass es sich nur noch um eine Aufzählung zusammenhangsloser Ereignisse handelt. """"Cause & Effect"""" muss her!! """"Wieso ist X passiert und was löste es aus?"""" Das muss rein, sonst bringt die History Sektion rein gar nichts. Du könntest theoretisch jeden Satz, den du geschrieben hast, an eine andere Stelle setzen und den Kontext würde das überhaupt nicht beeinflussen, ... denn es gibt keinen Zusammenhang - es bleibt eine Aufzählung. Jeder, der die Geschichte Deutschland verstanden hat, weiß zwar, was gemeint ist, aber was ist mit den anderen?   """"Zuerst kam es zu Revolutionen, dann traf sich plötzlich grundlos ein Parlament, wahrscheinlich, um weitere Revolutionen zu unterbinden, aber dann erwies sich auf einmal die Revolution als ergebnisslos (und ging mit einem Null zu Null in die Halbzeitpause?), denn der König lehnte ohne Grund - wie alles andere in der deutschen Geschichte - die Kaiserkrone, welche nichts mit der Revolution zu tun hat, ab, und Gott löste das Parlament auf, möglicherweise weil es zu überhaupt KEINER Verfassung gekommen ist. Sie haben es ja auch nur versucht, nicht geschafft! Auch grundlos unterdrückten die Fürsten die 1848 Austände - und zwar, gleich nachdem es zu den 1848er Revos gekommen ist. Die Revolution ging ja net bis 1849. Die Fürsten hatten offensichtlich noch nie den revolutionären Forderungen nachgegeben. Und außerdem wurde der Wiener Kongress wieder aufgebaut. Durch diese vier Gründe, die in KEINEM Zusammenhang zueinander stehen, bewies sich die Revolution als ungültig ... warum auch immer. Am Ende gab es einen zweiten Urknall und Bismarck war an der Macht, nicht der Kaier. Da hat das Schicksal sich mal wieder einen üblen Scherz geleistet"""" So könnte man den letzten Teil verstehen.  Es hat sich ja wirklich gelohnt die 18 Zeilen von """"Restoration and Revolution"""" auf 15 zu reduzieren!  Vom Inhalt zum Fokus der beiden Versionen.   Die Industrielle Revolution war also irrelevant? Dann frage ich mich, warum ihr ein GESAMTES Kapitel in den meisten Geschichtsbüchern gewidmet wird. In anderen Worten: Der Industriellen Revolution, """"Europas Aufbruch in die moderne Geselschaft"""", wird genauso viel Gewicht zugesprochen wie der Weimarer Republik, der nationalsozialistischen Diktatur in Deutschland und Deutschland nach 1945. In dem Artikel erhalten jedoch die eben genannten viel Platz, während die industrielle Revolution jetzt völlig leer ausgeht. Davor beanspruchte sie gerade mal eins, zwei Sätze. Ich kann verstehen, warum du sie nicht als bedeutend ansiehst, denn normalerweise steht sie nicht im selben Kontext wie die anderen Ereignisse. Wie kann sie auch? Sie erstreckt sich über das gesamte Jahrhundert und hat keinen genauen Anfangs- oder Endpunkt. Sie erhält nicht zuletzt deswegen ihr eigenes Kapitel. Auch wenn sie in der Oberstufe fast komplett ignoriert wird, erhält sie in der Mittelstufe viel Aufmerksamkeit.  Die Biedermeierzeit war der Rückzug der Geselschaft ins Privatleben wegen der scheiß politischen Situation. Bis heute gibt es so genannte """"Biedermeiermöbel"""", wenn das dir 'was sagt. Ich gebe zu, so wichtig ist diese Zeit nicht, aber immerhin hat sie eine von sieben Aufgaben der Kursarbeit über die Zeit dargestellt, und im Text verbraucht sie gerade mal 6 Wörter, also so gut wie nichts.  Im Gegensatz zu dieser Zeit ist der Vormärz von größter Bedeutung. Es gibt zwar keinen Link für einen englischen Artikel, aber probier mal den {de:Vormärz}. Wie du siehst bist du eigentlich derjenige, der sich an unbedeutenden Ereignissen, wie dem Wartburgfest, aufhängt.  Des Zollvereins Bedeutung liegt hauptsächlich darin, dass er die wirtschaftliche Einigung vor der politischen war. Er trägt zwar viel auch zum Österreich-Preußen Verhältnis bei und schaffte die Voraussetzung für einen Binnenmarkt in Deutschland, aber das sind eher Nebengründe. Wie beim Euro kündigt die wirtschaftliche Einigung auch eine politische an (ok, die gleiche Währung kam erst mit der Reichsgründung, aber im Prinzip sind sie sehr ähnlich. Und das habe ich mir nicht ausgedacht, sondern aus älteren Unterrichts-Mitschriften entnommen.).  Tschuldige für meinen unnötigen Sarkasmus. Hab mal wieder zu lange Moore gelesen und war etwas schlecht gelaunt, nicht nur weil ich sehe, wie ein Abschnitt an dem ich einen halben Tag scheinbar verschwendet habe, so schnell wieder den Bach runtergeht. Ich sehe auch einfach nur keinen Sinn, dieses Jahrhundert noch weiter zu reduzieren, während der erbärmlich geschriebene Abschnitt über die Weimarer Republik und das dritte Reich zusammengefasst werden könnte und sollte, oder ist zB den Prozentsatz an Stimmen für die Kommunisten für Deutschland so extrem",0

One of a vast number of examples, the connections in these passages are widely overlooked:   2Jn1:1 The elder unto the elect *lady* AND *her children*, whom I *love in the truth*; and not I only, but also all they that have *known the truth*;  2Jn1:5 And now I beseech thee, *lady*, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that *which we had from the beginning*, that we *love* one another.  John15:26 But when the *Comforter* is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even *the Spirit of truth*, which proceedeth from the Father, [he/(she)] shall testify of me:  John14:26 But the *Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost*, whom the Father will send in my name, [he/(she)] shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.  Prv8:22 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.  Prv8:23 I was set up from everlasting, *from the beginning*, or ever the earth was.  Prv8:24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.  Prv8:25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:  Prv8:26 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.  Prv8:27 When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:  Prv8:28 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:  Prv8:29 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:  Prv8:30 Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;  Prv8:31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.  Prv3:18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.  It is also overlooked what the Promise spoken of in the Bible actually is:  Deu6:3 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath *promised thee*, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.  Luke3:16 John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: *he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost* and with fire:  Acts2:33 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father *the promise of the Holy Ghost*, [he/(she)] hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.  Prv1:20 *Wisdom* crieth without; [she] uttereth [her] voice in the streets:  Prv8:11 For *wisdom* is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are *not to be compared to [it\(her)]*.  The above is just one example, not even the tip of the iceburg. Additionally, a vast wealth of information is gleaned by going back to the original Hebrew/Aramaic/Greek of the Bible. Those languages are so colorful in word meaning, that looking to the original words, and word roots in conjunction with realizing the Word of God is a book of parables, only then do we begin to see light.   Psa78:2 I will *open my mouth in a parable*: I will utter dark sayings of old:  Prv1:23 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will *pour out my spirit unto you*, I will make known my words unto you.  Jer31:15 Thus saith the LORD; A *voice was heard in Ramah*, lamentation, and bitter weeping; *Rahel weeping for her children* refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.  Jer31:16 Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for *thy work shall be rewarded*, saith the LORD; and *they shall come* again from the land of the enemy.  Jer31:17 And there is *hope in thine end*, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come again to their own border.  Rom5:5 And hope maket",0

On the other hand there is a very large grey area of relative significance where we avoid treading and if an item is of sufficient signifance for OTD, relative significance is probably the last area we will tread anyway.

""" February 2009 (UTC) Well, hope the floor didn't hurt. But your characterization of my attitude and what I respect and don't is to say the least dubious. Did it occur to you that I didn't attend your schools, have different experiences, different parents, and can think for myself? There is plenty of room for differences in interpretation, as anyone that has mediated flame wars here, as I have can tell you. One cranky old editor spouting off does NOT make for a battle. OTOH, similar frank opinions have almost universally in the past resulted in a good working relationship, a clear communication, and about 3/4ths of the time, resulted in a new Wikifriend. So piffle to WP:CIVyou're not looking at the context, nor the intent of the context for that guideline. Being polite can in fact be counterproductive and a time waste, a matter of judgmentmine, as the observer. Take Quiddity (who signed up at page top for example) who once demonstrated a unbelievable tendency to pro-offer unwarranted judgments and unsolicited advice. Ultimately, I had to get firm with him and sent this, which he threatened to post, SO I DID. Nothing there to be ashamed of, you see. Bottom line... there are some people in this world that need rapped along side the ear to get their attention. There are others that need to have their toes stepped on, UNTIL THEY APOLOGIZE. Both those types benefit some by being jerked up by the shorthairs. Failing all else, it makes me feel better, and communicates at least one person, however crazy they may think me, has less than steller appreciation for their actions as they impact othersnormally others time. I really don't get excised much here about anything else. Endless editing and all that, after all.Sooooo, Thanks for the appeal to my vanity, but I suggest in the future you counsel people to examine whether a situation is ongoing, escalating, or one time episode of venting. I spent 2-1/2 years here acting as a mediator myself, and would never have considered involving myself in an isolated message based case. Not sensible. Call it justifiable road rage if you like—a real world situation here in cyber space, and  at least I cleaned up the vulgarity of what I had written in the first three drafts, to make my loathing judgment of his lazy rape of hundreds of pages plain. THAT is where I put my loyalty and focus. NOT on one of thousands of arguable interpretation of various guidelines and policies. If your INTERPRETATION of WP:CIV prohibits any colorful idiom or addressing a dumbshit-thing-to-do as a dumbshit act, I'm definitely done here. I'm floored that you haven't the imagination to understand that— save for the hyperbole about kicking ass, a deliberate attempt to indicate how poorly I viewed the 5-6 hours a day of well over six weeks of effort fixing his rape pogrom allegedly following guidelines — nor the fact that you were all being busy-bodies making much ado about nothing. One of the most reprehensible facts about contributing here is that there is a total insensitivity to the leisure time our contributors make, particularly by 'blithely accepting actions', one way or another, deleting their hard work and effort, which is about as personal an attack as one can make... Show me where NPA THE LEAST SENSITIVE to that VERY REAL, VERY PERSONAL virtual 'slap in the face'.  And fools wonder why we have editor retention rate problems! Wake the fuck up. THAT IS A REAL WORLD PROBLEM, not my slight episode of 'hitting' to administer a lesson in courtesy to others. (Call me twisted, but a single discourtesy to me  administered to make the point is properly due those who exercise the ultimate discourtesies, really without due process. Making 180 article pages into redirects without involving the community at large in the decision is to me, WP:BOLD applied way over the top. AFD or MFD should have been invoked, at the least. Not one talk page and three or four editors without a direct attempt to re-involve the originator of same articles, or their major contributors. BOTH THOSE badly need a quorum count provision, but I digress, the digression.) Those articles nearly 200 some were something apparently dozens put up... involving hundreds of man-hours and were well crafted. Oh, they needed some cites for a few fannish statements of cause and effect, but the necessity of that is itself doubtful in cultural articles about recently produced intellectual efforts. WP:AGF should be sufficient for such a report making a statement like """"this is the first (last) episode character/actor-so-and-so appeared in, and so forth.

"""""""Vaguely""""?!  Really?!  I've explained this in great detail, ... but whatever.  Let me see if I can clearly explain how these subjects interrelate:Various figures of differing fame have proposed teleological arguments for the existence of God (technically any god, but for all practical matters, this mostly concerns the Christian God).  These arguments from design are described in the Teleological argument article.  They are rarely referred to as simply """"intelligent design,"""" and thus, have little to no claim to that term for its common name.A specific teleological argument is presented as science and an alternative to evolution.  This purportedly scientific theory is called Intelligent design (ID) and it is described here, in the Intelligent design article.  It is not necessarily associated with the Discovery Institute, and therefore claiming that this is the """"DI version"""" is inaccurate.  There are no strict """"versions"""" of the teleological argument anyway; there are different arguments from design made by different people, and they are identified by the philosopher/theologian who proposed them.From my perspective, the articles are well-organized, though not above improvements.  If the name of the article on the """"scientific theory"""" is a problem, we ought to have a discussion about the names of these articles, instead of trying to manipulate the lead of this one and obscure its topic.  If """"Intelligent design"""" is deemed to be the common name of the subject currently described in Teleological argument, there needs to be a discussion with the folks there to change the name.  This article can then be renamed to something else (in the past, I've suggested adding creationism to the title).For a less verbose explanation, see dave souza's comment above.

"Amazon tokens Hi, I think that you are doing well with the GA review on the parathyroid gland. There are certain things about it that I would find difficult to describe quickly that makes me think that it is nudging GA status, but not quite there yet. Of course, the parathyroid glands and PTH are only part of a system that regulates Ca and PO4. Parathyroids have a thin capsule. According to my books, the sizes can be asymmetrical, so it would be better to say that a normal parathyroid gland is less than 60 g, than give the average weight. If you think that I could contribute something to the final phase of the GA over the next week or two, then I would appreciate it if you could check my grammar of anything that I added to the article.

""" suggestions for corrections Hi,I'm not a native english speaker, so I hesitate to edit some mistakes myself:Whether the sarcophagus was ever intended to house a body is unknown. It is too short to accommodate a medium height individual without the bending of the knees, a technique not practiced in Egyptian burial, and no lid was ever found.I never heard about the sarcophagus being too short, this is certainly not generally accepted knowledge.Also, there are many other presumed items missing, such as the portcullis blocks (alleged remnants are left), some kind of slide connecting gallery and ascending passage, entrance blocks and the entire floor of the queens chamber. Keep in mind that the pyramid was open for centuries with no guards whatsoever-only immovable or almost immovable structures remained until the first attempts to a professional description of the interior more than 3000 years after construction.Egyptologists suggest the chamber was intended to be the original burial chamber, but that King Khufu later changed his mind and wanted it to be higher up in the pyramid.The 'change in plans'-theory has been suggested by some, but AFAIK is rejected by contemporary egyptologists such as Lehner and Stadelmann. Instead, they suggest an intended unfinishedness for religious purposes.The Greeks believed that slave labour was used but modern Egyptologists accept that it was built by many tens of thousands of skilled workers.Not """"the Greeks"""", but Herodot writes about slaves, a myth which seem to be ineradicable. He visited the pyramids 2000 years after the construction and beside naming the builders correctly, had not much of a clue about anything else.The Great Pyramid is the only pyramid known to contain both ascending and descending passages.I'd say the satellite pyramid of the bent pyramid counts, too. It has a remarkable similarity to the great gallery as well. Minor point, I know.The National Geographic Society filmed the drilling of a small hole in the southern door, only to find another larger door behind it.I know Hawass said that during the show, but no other egyptologist believes that. Look at the images yourself. There have been no further attempts made to """"open"""" the alleged door. I'd say, don't call it a second door until proven otherwise. The shafts seem to end in this tiny room-a very similar structure can be found in the southern upper shafts as well, by the way.Joyce Tyldesley states that the Great Pyramid itself """"is known to have been opened and emptied by the Middle Kingdom""""I wonder where Mr. Tyldesley got that information from. I am not aware of any ancient source regarding the opening of the pyramid. While I believe it has happened, and during the first intermediate period, there is nothing but vague hints in old egyptian sources-I think the term """"known"""" is exaggerated. Herodot and Diodor claim to have been inside-that points to the pyramid being open around 450 bc, but at which point the opening happened remains uncertain. Hope this is helpful!213.39.133.27  """,0

Thanks for your kindness. I could hardly explain the critical facts/reasons of blocking, since, if you read my rather long discussions above, it appears that, I still have to ask the blocking administrator, the details (terse facts of how, what, when, where, circumstances, from the very short time of about 1 day and a half, I had been warned not to add in my edits, the legal name and age of User:Cma, until the time I was blocked). Unfortunately, I cannot find the links of the ANI. I will have to prepare a rather terse but good argument for the appeal. Note that when I posted the template, instead of submitting the reason as mandated by template, I asked for time to submit the reasons or grounds, hence, automatically, the declining administrator denied my 1st appeal.

As for your argument that the article shouldn't talk about Technocracy's ideas and goals, etc. well I find that a bizarre suggestion.

That would be like saying that the article on say, the Republican Party (United States) (or any other group we care to mention), shouldn't have any info on what that group advocates. Obviously it should have as much info as possible, the only thing that matters is that it is presented in an accurate and neutral way.Eh, you said there existed entries on Technocracy in some encyclopaedias, can I ask which ones? As for using them as sources, I don't think we're actually meant to use one encyclopaedia to write another, as that would be getting the info second or third had, and the other encyclopaedias must have eventually derived their knowledge of Technocracy from the movement itself and it's literature, so I see no reason not to simply present that info first had. Besides, I've not seen any online encyclopaedias that have better information about Technocracy than this article, I believe I've seen brief overviews, but nothing of any great detail (of-course if you know of any articles that have potentially useful info, then go ahead and present it).

"""    == C'mon Guys ==  Lets get serious here, this is a show on Television and  AOTS is trying to see if they have INTELLIGENT viewers  (A.K.A. Boys and Girls who can keep their minds of their  """"Joysticks"""" and """"G-Spots"""" for more than 3 seconds) and  allow these viewers to help create a great episode of the  show. Now, understand, I'm no fun nazi, I just want this  thing to kick some arse (Perhaps be a 20 on a previous  users Ass-Kickery scale? Somewhere up there with... I don't  know... someone who devotes their life to kicking big arse!)  So Lets at least TRY to follow some ground rules...  Perhaps we could put these on the front page so that future  Idea makers can... work with them to create a semi-sane  yet still completely wierd episode of AOTS. However, these  are just my thoughts, no one elses. (Hey! Originality! Wow!)  THE """"Guidelines"""" FOR AOTS WIKIPEDIA PROJECT TV  1. Come up with something original for Skits and the 6!       a. No Vader or Homerowed, something similarly recognizeable but c'mon, thats THEIR joke, not yours.    2. Obey the 30 second rule!       a. It's just like the 5 second floor-food rule don't pass 30 Seconds or YOU DIE.       b. Lets try and read all the previous skits before posting our own, maybe an Idea has already been presented that is similar to yours, if you have an addition.. post it in their idea with your name attatched!  3. Vulgar, Sexist, Racist, Ignorant Comments = Bad Times!       a. Lets be smart here folks, the producers of AOTS are not going to put anything on their show that could cause the show to look bad (which, is a fine line they walk anyway)       b. As much as I'm sure Sarah appreciates a thousand noobs accross America praising her like a trophy, it's been done. We know you think Sarah is hot, get over yourself and go back to your WoW game. Your Level 38 Orc just got a Steel Spike Tipped Club!  4. Changes should be made in the CORRECT Areas!       a. Don't screw with the template of the site just cause you think it's funny. AOTS and Wikipedia are collaberating just like we are to make this work, so don't make it harder for them by deleting sections of the page just so you can type out """"BRING BACK TechTV!"""" here's a news flash folks: Stations change, and there isn't much you can do to change that.       b. Dont' DELETE other peoples ideas and don't be rude when critiquing them. Someone else may have put alot of time into what they thought would be a good skit for AOTS opening so respect that, and we will not flame you to death.  5. If AOTS or Wikipedia delete something... DONT PUT IT BACK!       a. The powers that be on this site have rules, and when you break them or when you screw with something to much, they will remedy the situation. Understand that it's probably nothing personal, they just don't need a website that talks about Kevin giving sexual favors in the opening skit. It's not what wikipedia is about and it's CERTAINLY not what Kevin and AOTS are about.  5. Be your own Policeman!       a. Odd as it sounds, you have a concience and common sense! Use them! If it sounds like they wouldn't use your idea or you think they might delete what ever you put up right away... DONT PUT IT UP!       b. As you are coming up with ideas, check the site. See something obscene or something that 100% doesn't belong on a site that a 13 year old MIGHT see? DELETE IT! The AOTS and Wikipedia folks can't always be here to clean up after us, so help them by keeping this place as PG as possible. I know AOTS sometimes has sexual references, but thats called DISCRETE INNUENDOS. If you don't have the art of innuendo, don't post the idea, because they wont use it.  6. When Posting a Skit, THINK FIRST!       a. I may have stated this before but it's important. the three things to do when posting an idea are:           I. Check to see if your idea or a similar one is already up.           II. If one is found (or one you like better) expand/post on it, not a new entry.           III. If none is found, post your new entry while following the guidelines.       b. I promise you, this wont take you more than 5 minutes to do if done right.  7. When Posting a Top 6, THINK FIRST!       a. Just like with skits, you must do three things when posting a new idea:           I. Look at the current top 6, if you see one that is less cool than yours, switch it out. (moving the one switched to Honorable Mentions)           II. If you see that the top 6 are out of order, switch them around.           III. If your idea is not yet on the list, post it at the bottom, moving the one you bumped to honorable mentions.  ____________  I really think we can make this work if we try. Just...

"(UTC)  I plead guilty to original research in this case. I just removed the following paragraph, and replaced it with my own explanation of galling as a cold welding phenomenon:  :Galling can occur when metal parts, such as the threads of nuts and bolts, are forced together and rubbing generates friction between surface asperities. The friction causes heat, which is mainly isolated to these asperities. The asperities weld together but further displacement causes these tiny welds to break, which makes the surface even rougher, creating more opportunity for friction. Galling should not be confused with cold welding.  The friction welding explanation does not match my own observations, see the main article for more details. Unfortunately, I have never found a credible source discussing galling, so I have no references to offer.   I myself am an active researcher within the area of tribology, with particular focus on wear in sheet metal forming, which is often related to galling. Very often in text books, galling is used as a term describing cold welding, scuffing or severe adhesive wear for metals with no emphazises on that the metals should be a certain Fe-alloys or a pure element such as Al, as the previous author described. Generally, these materials materials are more suspectible to galling, but indeed other metals suffer from galling as well. The statement that carbon-steels do not suffer from galling is incorrect, which has been shown by several researchers including myself. If this was the case, than the automobile industry, as an example, should have no need for the use of press-lubricants during forming of carbon-steel components. But this is of course not the case.  However, the definition of galling as a single event, or wear mechanism, is very rarely used. Rather, most authors, including myself, use the expression to describe a wear process, composed of several regimes and wear mechanisms. A short description is the following: Initially when two surfaces are brought into contact and slid relative each other, a regime of mild wear is initiated, meaning that transfer of material from one surface to the other will occur. Generally material transfer occurs from the softer surface to the harder surface. This regime will continue for some sliding distance, depending on the loading, temperature, materials etc. The continuous pick-up of material on one surface localizes the contact, leading to a concentration of the contact pressure which subsequently localizes the areas of where material transfer occurs. Therefore, lumps of transferred material will grow in certain areas, which at a certain lump size initiates the entering into the second regime, where scratching of the counter-surface by the lump initiated. Generally, the lump hardness is increase by strain hardening and oxidation phenomena, which makes scratching possible. In this stage, the metal forming industry often starts to notice the phenomena of galling, since scratches begin to be visible on the formed parts. If the sliding is allowed to continue, at least in un-lubricated conditions, scratching will transfer into severe metallic adhesive wear, cold welding or scuffing etc, which is related with very high friction and possible seizure of the tool and work material.  /Anders  :If I understand you correctly, you're saying that the former friction-welding definition is closer to the truth than my cold-welding definition currently in the article. And yet this doesn't match my practical experience, which is that galling happens exclusively to corrosion resistant metals, and preferentially to similar mating materials. For example, even a 304 / 17-4 pair will gall less than either of those materials gall with themselves. I've found a weak web reference  which might make us both right. According to this, the mild wear regime which you describe will only occur after the oxide surface film has broken down, which of course is thinner on corrosion-resistant metals. Once that happens, material similarity would accelerate asperity accretion since it essentially becomes localized cold-welding. That will rapidly take us to the second regime where all the visible scratching occurs.  :In other words, the mechanism you explained is universal, (and may apply to carbon steels in unusual situations which I haven't seen,) but it is greatly magnified by cold-welding in corrosion-resistant metals. Is this a good technical basis for a better definition of galling? 04:37, 31 August 2007",0

""" Again, I am very grateful for the encouragement, but the way that EdJohnston has dealt with the matter (see his talk page for my complaint) simply shows me that mods and admins, in general, have a very biased view towards editors who simply wish to improve the quality of articles... present company excepted. I read with interest the candidate statements for the latest Arbitration Committee Election and one of them, a very senior Wikipedian, summed it up so aptly... """"We must clean our house, lest those who could advise and assist us dismiss Wikipedia as a nest of boobies. We should treat all editors alike. The best way to avoid being called a flock of juvenile loons is to stop acting like a flock of juvenile loons."""" Sadly, it is clear that prejudice and bias against some classes of contributors exists, and that the level of training, education and the ability to logically examine a conflict is woefully missing. It is inherently skewed. Although Ed has suggested referring the matter to the next level, it is clear, reading through all the Help pages, that Wiki has so many layers of arbitration, the complaint simply gets lost in the ensuing debate, and it then comes down to who is who in the Wiki org chart. The strap line that Wikipedia is the encyclopaedia that can be edited by ANYONE is a pie in the sky dream...it simply isn't true, as has been proven here. Looking through the dispute archives, there are tens of thousands of cases. Is it really worth it when more energy is expended in resolving obvious errors, and condoning poor attitude towards newbies, than in improving the site? So no, it can't be edited by anyone, it can only be edited by people who are approved, mates with other mods, or who make up false accusations and allegations against those who stand up to their incoherent and inaccurate edits. Quite sad really, as it could be quite good. But when there are people, like I've just encountered, who show no subject knowledge, logic, reasonableness, tolerance of new editors, and then blatantly lie to mods, to try and dig themselves out of their self-created holes, is it any wonder that people are leaving Wikipedia in droves (reading through complaint articles!)?  I came onto Wiki to contribute a few small lines to an article, about which I know an immense amount (I've been an RCVS patient for thirty plus years and have read the lot). But, the arrogance, unwelcome attitude, and air of """"keep off MY article"""" by a self-proclaimed (but unverified) medical 'expert' does little to encourage collation of information, let alone in the collaborative manner in which it is supposed to develop. At best, the experience of contributing to Wikipedia is eye-opening; at worst it is frankly shocking, and an almost bully-the-newbies-off mentality against anyone new who 'dares' to try and contribute. So, I wish you the best with it, but it is not the sort of self-grandising ego-centric cesspit of nastiness, and unnecessary argument that I wish to be a part. And do feel free to communicate this note to the upper echelons as yet another typical day in the life of a newbie contributor. Maybe, they may take note, but I doubt it very much, after all, too much ego is at stake in a majority of cases. Cheers! )""",0

But, I also see (through looking at the page history) for my other additions to the Ambit page where the accolades were taken down without providing me with an understanding of how it violated Wiki.  I saw the comment for the works cited to the newsvideos and now understand that possibly news casts available on YouTube are not allowed.  My question is this: if it is ok to input criticism of a company into it's wiki page, why not the awards and milestones that it has achieved (from independent sources who were properly cited)?  I am dumbfounded as to how one side, but not the other can be properly added and cited.  I do believe that it is paramount in Wiki to have a NPOV and I now realize after reading your comment on my Talk page that I could have used better verbiage.  Could you please point me in the right direction on how to properly add and cite recognition that a company receives vs criticism?  I have combed through several of the neutral POV topics that you have mentioned in others' comments, but I could not find an answer to my question.  Thank you in advance for your help.",0
"Numerical localization (visualization) of attractors Because of many pictures of attracters in the article, I think it would be good to add something aboutattractors visualization: From computation point of view, attractors can be naturally regarded as self-exciting attractors or  hidden attractors. Self-exciting attractors can be localized numerically by standard computational procedure, in which after transient process a trajectory, started from a point of unstable manifold in a small neighborhood of unstable equilibrium, reaches an attractor and computes it (such examples are classical attractor in Van der Pol,  Beluosov–Zhabotinsky,  Lorenz, and many others dynamical systems). While  basin of attraction of  hidden attractors does not contain neighborhoods of equilibria, and therefore hidden attractor cannot be localized by standard computational procedure.",0

"""What you were up to, you mean. From the beginning you're personally attacking me and harassing me, and this is the only way you found to try to claim ownership of articles.And yes, it's highly suspicious that you seem to monitor everything that happens between the IP and me. At worst, it shows that you're actually tracking down my edits, ie harassing me, at best, it proves you are the IP because without any communication with me or the IP, there is no way you can be aware of anything in so much details(unless you're harassing me). And no, that you happen to hear about this matter right after it occured, while nothing suggested you were active here for 2 days, cannot be coincidence.And finally, please, Buspar, stop playing on words. This is what the admin that took in charge your SSP case stated, and nothing else: """"Looking at contribs, User:Buspar and User:Xuanwu are very probably the same user. Technically, they cannot be socks, as one username was created after the other stopped editing"""". This statement is based on the technical definition of sockpuppetry, meaning that a person is using different identities at the same time. The admin only noted that the 2 accounts were not used simultaneously, but nonetheless acknowledged that Buspar and Xuanwu were the same person (""""Looking at contribs, User:Buspar and User:Xuanwu are very probably the same user."""")The admin, however, never confirmed that you were not the IPs Onethirtyeightdot suspected you to be. If you've seen the line """"No, Buspar is not 130.49.157.75"""", then please source it correctly.So, what do we have ? An admin confirming you're likely to use several identities, an anonymous IP acting in exactly the same way as you do, having the same personal issues with me, editing the very same articles as you do, reverting back into articles the very same contribs that you made, and it also seems both you and the IP seem to have a telepathic link allowing to know every issue occuring with the IP without you being contacted by it beforehand.As I've said, I'm offering to peacefully resolve this problem. I am sincerely convinced that Buspar is the IP, because I've noticed the very same edit pattern, because both users contribute to the same articles, and both users seem to have a personal issue against me and both seem to systematically revert my contributions as soon as they concern article about illegal downloading.Thus, this is not randmon bad faithed accusation. This is only what I sincerely believe.However, if it is absolutely proved that Buspar and the Ip are not the same and that Buspar and the IP don't behave in similar ways, then I'm ready to make excuses to both users and to stop identifying the Ip as Buspar. But if someone has any doubts about the IP identity, or if someone clearly acknowledge that Buspar and the Ip have the very same behavior and edit pattern, then that's all I need. I won't continue to call the IP Buspar, on the condition that an admin clearly acknowledges the IP¨as being Buspar, and that Buspar in his future edits, only revert edits of mine and talk to me under his Buspar username.

"""  == poverty ==  I'm not Romanian, neither an expert on Romanian society, so I'm not sure, but the poverty rate for me doesn't seem so unrealistic. I mean, the poverty rate of 8% in Hungary is from 1993, which is right in the first phase of a major socioeconomic crisis, and in terms of poverty it was rather """"just"""" the beginning. Reportedly the worst years in terms of the emerging extreme poverty were 1993-1996, due to government policies and general economical collapse. For example in 1992 the number of active earners was 4,1777 million in 1993 it was 3,8884 million, and in 1997 3,657 million - in the same period the number of people who were registered as unemployed actually fell from 663000 to 477500. So I think it seems quite clear that the percentage of people living under the poverty level increased significantly from 1993 to 1997, and didn't change significantly since then. Actually, according to recent sociological research around 8% of Hungarians live in total, extreme poverty, which means almost complete segregation from the labour market and quite simply being unable obtaining enough food, normal housing etc.   The total percentage of people living under the subsistence level (circa half of the median income) is actually 25-30%.   This is Hungary, where the general macroeconomic situation is said to be much more favourable than in Romania, with the GDP/capita twice as high (13900$ by PPP in 2003) and the Gini-index 6,7 percent lower.  Of course, I don't know how the poverty level is calculated in Romania, but if it's done the same way than in Hungary (where it is 20-30% of the pop. below it) it is possible that it is as high as that.   Again, I don't really know the situation in Romania, so I can easily be wrong.""",0

"""No, Ketuanan Melayu was NEVER mentioned in the Constitution. It only mentions about """"Hak Keistimewaan orang Melayu"""". This is nothing but just the mentioned """"Aborigin Rights"""" just like most other countries, like Canada and Singapore. """"Ketuanan Melayu"""" was invented, but I'm not sure when is it exactly that it was first being used. One may say it is a derivation from the Article 153, but it has gone too far from beneficial - it has been abused and being used as a tool by Barisan Nasional for their own gain. The rationale behind Hak Keistimewaan Orang Melayu is that what they claimed that Malays are the Aborigins (although I don't really agree with this, the Peranakans has settled in Malacca during the 15th centuries!) - the true Aborigins are none other than Orang Aslis. Let's assume that the fact that Malays are aborigins are true. Article 153 never introduced """"Malays First"""" Policy, but rather the means to protect Malay rights as well as the rights of other races in this country. Article 153 is never controversial, but rather being ABUSED by certain politicians. I hope these makes it clear. The most prominent example that happens in this country right now is the government scholarship. You can read almost everywhere about this. Isn't this already an official discrimination? You can read more like the BTN courses who always refers the Chinese (include Peranakan generations) and Indians as """"pendatang"""", but the fact is that Parameswara himself is a Pendatang, (and also Khir Toyo).Although Malaysia is not officially an Enthnocracy, but we can see that Malaysia appears to be one. Enthocracy is not limited to particular race in government positions, but it refers also to racial policies and practises. The definition of Ethnocracy includes """"and use them to advance the position of their particular ethnic group(s) to the detriment of others"""". Under the Malays First Policy (NEP, MARA, and many more) this is indeed very clear without further elaboration.Note: If don't agree with anything with me or any other people who writes this article, please refer to this talk page.

"== Growth and dissolution eras ==  The era classification in the History of the Ottoman Empire sidebox needs attention.   *The growth era is between 1453-1683. This means that the Ottoman Empire continued to grow in the 17th century. But it is not true. To be sure, Podolia and Crete were annexed. But  Anatolia, the core of the empire was in ruins. The empire was living the worst days as far as the public peace, cultural life and economy are considered. Vast areas in Caucasus and West Iran had been lost. The barbary states were almost independent. The reason the empire didn't disantegrate was the Thirty Years' War in Europe. The classical classification is better. The growth era must end by the end of the 16th century. (either by the death of Sokullu  Mehmet Pasha in 1579 or by the Peace of Zsitvatorok in 1606.)  *The dissolution era between 1908-1922 is quite meaningless. All Balkan countries (except Albania) and all African countries (except Libya) had already been lost by 1908 and the remainning territory was under the supervision of great powers of Europe.

As executive director of the Church Council of Greater Seattle he is a frequent contributor to public debate about religion, social justice, and medical ethics.  Since becoming director of the Council, over 150 articles in Seattle media have featured the work of his organization.    Brown is one of the few Washington citizens successfully to contest an election.  In 2000, the election of City of Wenatchee mayor Gary Schoessler was successfully contested by Brown and his associate, Rev. Kel Groseclose.  In 2005 Brown received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from his alma mater, Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary.

""" You asked: Do I want Esperanza back? I'm sorry, I don't really know whether or not I do anymore. There is a pervasive fad in taking a """"bootcamp"""" attitude to what wikipedia contributors can do, and it seems toward the end that Esperanza tried to conform to this belief rather than defy it, as evident in the paradigm shift during Esperanza's overhaul as well as the community's deletion of the coffee lounge and most games on wikipedia. This is why I am hesitant to develop an opinion either way: what kind of Esperanza are we talking about here? FWIW, I don't believe that getting rid of silly perks ever did anything good. Personally, I never played any of the games (as I recall) but their presence made a difference. I suppose it's hard for me to explain, but sometimes the mere possibility or existence of something achieves much more than any active working process, which is what Esperanza did for me.

As to """"favorable vs. unfavorable,"""" if that's truly how I felt, such incidents articles wouldn't exist. I've gone through with SpikeJones and other editors to keep everything consistent, first getting involved with them after the monorail accident in July 2009, when this exact same issue came up, and again consensus was that leaving out the victim's name didn't damage the article, nor did it add any significant value to it (at which point, tie goes to """"leave it out""""). After that, it was the rash of lewd-behavior incidents at Central Florida water parks ... again, if I was trying to protect the parks, I wouldn't have allowed the information in, as if it were completely up to me, anyway. Heck, I added a number of them into their respective articles, and I fleshed out others with more details and more source information to back it all up! (In the interest of full disclosure, the victims in those incidents were generally minors, which (a) wouldn't have been named by the news and (b) if some unscrupulous person had gotten a hold of the names, I have no doubt the names would be expunged immediately and nobody who really had the project's best interests at heart would put up a fight. In not so many words, while also incidents, they did have special conditions that don't make them good examples in this dispute.)These incidents articles are based purely on what's in the local newspapers, with no candy-coating, no PR spin ... save one thing, which has been followed with almost all the incident/accident articles I've reviewed, both theme-park and non-theme-park. Unless they were already notable, victims' names aren't included, because they aren't necessary to, as you put it, tell the story. There are, of course, exceptions (such as the victims of the Titanic), but the theme park incident articles are consistent.Lastly, as to your assertion of WP:COI, I'd welcome any proof you'd care to provide in regards to edits being made currently. Previous COI edits, such as those that inspired the newspaper article you cited, should indeed be expunged and replaced by neutral point of view information. But that's an issue for another day.

"""This article is now considerably less lame than a month ago. However, the problem I still have with it is that the way the various POVs are presented implies that the fate of the peace process depends on the goodwill of the Palestinians, which appears uncertain, and hence Israel is the victim of their apparent duplicity. Let's be real: Israel is the occupying force here and has far, far greater military might (not to speak of economic power). The Palestinians are virtually mendicants. Hence it is ludicrous to quote Faisal Husseini calling for """"the liberation of all Palestine from the river to the sea"""" without placing it within the governing geopolitical reality: Israel is armed to the teeth, backed by the even more powerful USA, and has between 200 and 400 nuclear warheads.

""":::::: The numbers are indeed possible. First is that the numbers from the 1997 election cannot be used to compare to the current one becuase this was before the point in which the youth would take on a much bigger position than they did today. the conservatives were still around and the youth could not vote then, but now the youth can vote and the conservatives have either died or changed to rather anti-Ahmadinejad. The conservative candidate was nothing like ahmadinejad so he could have had a good 8 million votes. And if you add Rezaee votes with it it comes around 9 million for the consevatives in total. 60% of iran is under 30, and they only know problems under this regime or more specifically, this administration. Besides Ahmadinejad is massively unpopular and the numbers from his previous election are going to decrease because of the increase in sanctions and further isolation from the rest of the world. YOu cannot think that his approval will go up because the nuclear program was started long before ahmadinejad, he just publicized it and his threats against Israel further promoted them, He makes useless provocations against the Holocaust, going as far enough to invite David Duke to tehran to talk about it, and this is not going to promote him very well. Next, most of the programs in Iran were started in the Khatami or even Rafsanjani administration. so the fact the claim that he is supporting the poor is dubious and the Iranians realize this because he has slowed them down or stopped them wholly, in order to pay russia or the military. And he has also placed Gas rationing on one of the largest producers of oil in the world. Point, being Ahmadinejad is not going to be quite popular, even within the conservative corners of the government. Karroubi is popular where ahmadinejad supposedly is so I dont see anything wrong with his votes and the upper class and middle class are going to vote for mousavi. Some of the lower class are going to vote for mousavi since they remember his handeling of the economy in the 80's so that will give him lots of extra votes. Rezaee is still really hated due to his running of the revolutionary guard in the 80's. And do you think that the government was going to tolerate a runoff between two reformists that each got more votes than the conservatives combined. Absolutely not in a million years. So the numbers are reasonable as mentioned above. Next is that you cannot rely on polls in Iran or whatever any government group is going to say. The polls that are """"official"""" are made by the government. you know what I mean. and the groups (the islamic participation front) cannot know the exact extent of their popularity because the people fear evin if the open their mouths.Second point is that i might have contradicted myself earlier. Any memo that is made by the government is going to have the seal on it, making it offical, period. It does not have any numbers in order to prevent trails as I mentioned Earlier. Im going to leave this on the page. The first reason is that the letter, wheather fake or not, is being widely circulated around Iran, so it is being used as a catalyst to the protests. The second is that Wikipedia is not a forum in order to determine wheather or not a document is fake or not, If the document is of encyclopedic value, as it is being actively used within the situation as it is in the protests it should be kept. wheather it is fake or not, It is evidence that is being actively used there is vote rigging, (Talk) """,0

""" Regarding Joseph E Prince Please explain why you deleted this page - this is a verifiable story at imdb.com under Liberation Saturday   I deleted Joseph E Prince under WP:CSD#A7, because it listed a person who was a high school and college athlete but did not participate at any professional level. These did not seem to be assertions of notability to me. In re-reading the deleted article, I do see that there was an assertion: He is most noted for 2008 short documentary Liberation Saturday... which technically disqualifies this article for speedy deletion. That doesn't mean the subject is notable, but if you wish me to restore it I will do so. You may reasonably expect someone else to nominate it for deletion, however; being the subject of a documentary is not generally considered to confer notability. (Note that the film does not have an article either.) When you recreated the article two days later and a different admin deleted it, the same A7 reason was given, and that deletion was correct, as it did not even assert notability.

""" stradbroke galleon etc Hallo HesperianJust thought I should send you a copy of my comments on the end of your little witch hunt. Yes you won, bully for you, I hope it makes you feel like a big man. I look forward to when I bump into you in the flesh so we can sort this out the old fashioned way; face to face. that will be fun!!!hallo Moondyne, I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments. I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by """"mainstream"""" academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the """"mainstream"""" view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian's antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different. Still it is dissapointing. Happy trails. Gregjay (talk) Retrieved from """"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Moondyne""""""",0

"""  :IMHO you are reading your POV into Price's statements.  There is nothing in what he is saying that shows he """"repudiated"""" FIT only that he could not find evidence of it being the primary cause.  In fact in chapter 18, Price states """"In my investigations regarding the types of individuals who develop rheumatic group lesions as a result of dental focal infections, (1) I found that individuals could be divided into very definite groups in which 15.05 per cent with severe lesions belonged to families in which similar disease symptoms had occurred. Evidence was disclosed of a systemic factor that played a controlling role in determining whether or not the individual would be seriously injured from dental focal infections. It became very clear that the soil was quite as important a determining factor as was the type of infection.""""  :Later on Price reiterates """"(i)t is very important that in the consideration of the dental caries problem it shall be kept in mind continually, that it is only one of a large group of symptoms of modern physical degeneration and when teeth are decaying other things are going wrong in the body. Fluorine treatment, like dental extractions, cannot be a panacea for dental caries.""""    :On a related side note the 1930 Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine, Volume 23, Issue 2 pg 1184 which mentions Price's work states """"dental sepsis is the commonest focus of infection in the body and must be garded as one of the most frequent sources of disease of adult life.""""  Remember that Pallasch specifically mentioned untreated pulpless teeth as being one of the many foci of infection in his 2000 article and his 2003 article goes over oral FIT past and present commenting on Price's work and states """"In the 1920s, the theory of focal infection was widely taught as the cause of a wide range of illnesses with infected teeth as the principal source"""".  It certainly doesn't help that dental sepsis covers a lot of ground including Tooth abscess and by that standard FIT is anything but dead in the dental community.  :Of course that goes back to the whole problem with FIT itselfeven if you limit yourself to Billings the mechanism covers an insane range of modern diseases including ones recognized by modern dentistry.   In that sense FIT itself never diedit just stopped being the be and end all as far as systemic disease was concerned.  :There are some other points we still need to fix in there article.  The fact that in 1918 there were issues regarding the FIT inspired extraction craze shows that Price's works didn't """" led to the widespread acceptance of the practice of extracting"""" as the article currently claims.  Furthermore if you actually go to the 2007 version of Ingle's the material does not support the claim it is being used to reference!  In fact, Ingles states that is was the work of British physician William Hunter in 1910 that lead orgy of extractions and the 100 percenters and then it talks about Price beginning his 25-study regarding FIT.

"Incompleteness As I heard the story of the Carson City Mint, it started life as a private operation, because the US Treasury refused to build a branch to accommodate the Comstock Lode.  When the government attempted to close it down and prosecute the operators for counterfeiting, the prosecution was defeated by the detail that the dollar coins were fractionally overweight.  The street price of silver in Carson City was low enough to still permit a profit on the minting. Thus, unable to prevent the minting of silver coins in Carson City, the Treasury took over operations and pocketed the fractional overweight.  Even if this story is inaccurate, I believe the story ought to be included, perhaps with its disproof, but it does shed light on the issue of the discrepancy between the value of silver as a commodity and as currency.",0

(These will be 2 solutions, but only one can be close to the surface of the Earth, so this is not a practical problem.)  With 4 satellites you need only a crude clock, provided your hardware measures the 4 satellites at (almost) the same time.  This allows you to solve for x,y,z, and t.

I realise that the airport infobox isn't yet ready for universal implementation, but I thought it a worthwhile edition to the major Australian airports. I had no intention of adding it to all Australian airports, for the time being at least. It was hard enough to find the stats for the major aiports, let alone attempting the minors. For the templates you've created, great work! I did a little bit of re-arranging for the Australian airports -  """"Closest Town""""/""""Distance from"""" changed to city and IATA/ICAO codes moved lower. I've now created Template:Infobox Australian Airport, as  mentioned, based on that hybrid infobox, but have yet to implement it.   :Now, I'm the first to admit that I know next to nothing about template syntax. I work around this by using various exemplars. But having two separate templates, one for stats and one for runways, sounds like an awful complication. And I don't see how this will change the problem of some airports having more runways then others - though I am perhaps blinded by my inexperience. However, this idea does make sense for smaller airports, where it might be very hard to get information on either. Nevertheless, I think there should be one infobox in, say, four different versions: v1 2 runways; v2 3 runways; v3 4 runways; and, v4 5 runways. This is what I may do with Template:Infobox Australian Airport, though only two versions would be required. Thoughts? """,0

"Invitation to workshops on Wikipedia editingDear Ploversegg,We are a team of researchers at the University of Oxford and AU Sharjah, researching the experiences of editors of content about the Arab world on Wikipedia. We are interested in your experiences of editing Wikipedia and are organising two events that we think you would be an excellent contributor to.First, starting next week on Monday 27th August, we are hosting an online discussion about what it is like to contribute to Wikipedia in Arabic and to articles about the Middle East and North Africa. We are interested in what barriers you perceive to exist in Wikipedia, how articles can be made better and generally what can be done to expand and improve Arabic Wikipedia. This discussion will take place on a MediaWiki hosted at our institution and be available in English and Arabic. We will allow users to create their own discussion pages in addition to our discussions.Second, we are hosting face-to-face workshops in Cairo from 21st-22nd October 2012. If you are interested in this we may be able to pay your travel and accommodation costs depending on where you live. This workshop will cover similar themes to the online discussion but will allow participants to meet one another and benefit from being together.  We will take care of the organization and planning and all you have to do is show up and be ready to discuss. But if you would like to help shape some of the discussion themes in advance, please let us know. We have booked time in the workshops for Wikipedian-led discussions.  More details can be found in our “Frequently Asked Questions” section below. We would be delighted to welcome you to either (or both) event. Please let me know (wikiproject@oii.ox.ac.uk) if you would like to participate and we can send you more details.Sincerely,Mark, Bernie, Ilhem, Ali, Ahmed and HeatherDr. Mark Graham, Oxford Internet Institute, University of OxfordDr. Bernie Hogan, Oxford Internet Institute, University of OxfordDr. Ilhem Allagui, Department of Mass Communication, American University of SharjahDr. Ali Frihida, National Engineering School of Tunis Heather Ford, Oxford Internet Institute, University of OxfordAhmed Medhat, Oxford Internet Institute, University of OxfordFrequently Asked Questions: What is the purpose of this project?This project is about who represents the Arab World on Wikipedia, and how the Middle East and the Arab world is represented on Wikipedia. We are studying Wikipedia through statistics, edit  history data and personal experiences. Our ultimate goal is to help Wikipedia grow in size and fairness and do academic research on this topic. You can read more about the project here: http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/?id=70 From this page, you can also find a biography of the researchers. You may also want to see our interactive visualizations about Wikipedia here: http://wikiproject.oii.ox.ac.uk/ Who is funding this project?This project is funded by the International Development Research Centre (http://www.idrc.ca). This organization is funded by the Canadian government to improve infrastructure across the world, including online content. We have been working with the IDRC since June 2010. Why did you contact me?Because you’re awesome. In all seriousness, we have been looking through Wikipedia for active editors based on user activity in either Arabic Wikipedia or articles about the Arab world. We have not contacted everyone we could, but we contact people that we think will help to balance the discussion and help us (and each other) learn more about the state of Wikipedia.  Do I need to participate in both events?Not at all. You are welcome to participate in both or just one. We recognise that it will be more convenient for some people to have online conversations and for others to speak in person. For some people it will not be practical to fly to the Middle East, but we still consider their contributions important and want to give them a voice in this work.Can I use my Wikipedia handle in the online discussion?You do not need to use any particular name on the online forum. All we need is a valid email address so you can register. You can post using your real name, your Wikipedia name or a completely different nickname, whatever allows you to speak your mind most effectively. What sort of travel funding will you supply for the face-to-face workshop?We have funding for travel and accommodation costs for approximately twenty participants depending on where they are coming from.

"""No, actually, we're not here for the same reason.  I don't have a lot of experience with Wikipedia, and I'm not here to do lots of work on Wikipedia, and I don't read their policies (would take too much time - not really interested - I'm an armchair reader/editor of Wikipedia).  What I find with Wikipedia these days, is, to find out some detail/meat on a subject, one has to go to the edits and look at stuff that has been deleted.  There seems to be a huge effort by people to delete stuff on subjects they know nothing about.  I just got through going around in circles with a guy (I think he was also a Wikipedia administrator) where he deleted all sorts of stuff from the bio of Anthony Senter (a convicted Lucchese/Gambino mobster doing life for multiple murders).  The whole bio was taken from a well-known book called """"Murder Machine"""" and it was referenced at the bottom under """"References"""", but this guy wanted everything deleted if it didn't have a citation at the end of each sentence.  I had to tell him that the entire article came from that one book (and it's a good book, written by a well-known NY crime reporter).  What the guy/administrator should have done is first known the subject matter then edit - that way, he would have known that the whole thing was in fact already referenced at the bottom.  I tried putting in a few links but I couldn't get them to work (somebody else fixed them).  It's really too much work to go around and around in circles with these guys (they seem to be """"busybodies"""") as they delete and delete and delete, when in fact the items are either (1) well known to anybody that knows the subject matter (like Conrad's friendship with Spilotro), or (2) they are very easily found.

""", 21 July 2015 (UTC) Sure.  So in this particular case, here is what I found.  You've been name-dropped in WaPo.  Usually, that would make you an auto-implied-endorsement... but rather than being 'strategist' or some kind of 'senior advisor' or whatever, your job title was CTO... somewhat strange for a political campaign to *have* somebody with that job-title.  Hence, I didn't count it as an auto-implied-endorsement, but looked further.  This is relatively unambiguous:   Ron Schnell, computer programmerhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/06/30/supreme-court-passes-on-google-oracle-case-rand-pauls-campaign-hosts-a-hackathon/ at NSUhttp://cec.nova.edu/faculty/adjlist.html  But there is some wiggle room, there.  And thus, the question is:  1) per WP:ABOUTSELF, is that a public endorsement, by a """"celebrity programmer"""" of sorts?  or alternatively, is that a public endorsement, by a """"celebrity professor"""" of sorts?  I originally put you down as a prof, because of your earliest press being for NYU, and your current job being adjunct prof, and your years at Syracuse.  You have obviously been a programmer, but you've also obviously been in academia (of one type or another ... sysadmin at ITS counts in my book) for a very long time.  Paul has specific platform-planks that impact the world of computer science, and the computer industry:  net neutrality, NSA data-collection, and more.  There are likely to be copyright-related issues in the 2016 election (cf the oracle-vs-google lawsuit over whether the fundefs in an API are """"copyright"""" or rather """"fair use"""" in terms of Java libcalls  this is probably more important than the look and feel lawsuits of the 1980s).  So, I could see a case where as a programmer-slash-professor, you would endorse based on your understanding of the economic impact in the computer industry, much like Walter Block endorsed as an academic who is an economics prof (despite disagreeing with Paul on specific issues like the correct governmental level for dealing with vaccinations  they agree on economics and thus Block endorsed).  Then there is the third possibility, which is the endorsement as a staffer.  Although you are a new face as a political consultant, that doesn't necessarily make a staffer-endorsement less valuable; in some ways, it makes your endorsement more wiki-noteworthy, because you *are* an outsider, who wasn't hired based on your implied-and-pre-existing endorsement, like most of the professional-political-staffer-hires tend to be.         Finally, I will point out that per WP:BLP, wikipedians are pretty careful when making statements about BLPs, yourself included, as well as Rand Paul.  It is 'saying something' about Paul when somebody is listed as endorsing him, but even more so, it is 'saying something' about you when we list you as an endorsement-giver.  Since this is a borderline case, wikipedians usually just defer to what the BLP wants to happen (in this case you).  If you want to be listed as an endorsement-giver, because it is a true statement, per WP:COI you should not insert yourself.  But I already inserted you, along with a ton of other staffer-endorsements (most of the implied variety but one or two that were more carefully quotation-laden).  And that was before we became wiki-involved during the AfD of the Dunnet videogame, so it still stands an the action of an uninvolved editor.  In other words, if you'd rather be left off the list, that's fine, just say so, and why.  If somebody else inserts you into the article, don't remove yourself from the article-mainspace, per wiki-COI behavioral rule#1, but instead ask for assistance.  It will also help if you post something WP:ABOUTSELF to your blog, which says that you are not yet formally endorsing any candidate in the race, although that's not necessary at present (only if some other editor re-inserts you).  On the other hand, if after reading this, and looking over the list at Endorsements for the Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016, you end up deciding that you do belong on the list (either under the academia-subsection or under the ce",0

''''''    :No problem. )      == P90x Link ==  Hello, I noticed you removed the link to fitnesstrainingreview from the P90x article.  First, let me explain that I know Chelsea from that article, as she was in a class of mine.  She was always talking to me about p90x whenever I was complaining about my shape.  She gave me a link to a website she was starting (fitnesstrainingreview) as well some other info on P90x.  About a week later I was doing more research on P90x and came across the wiki article which had the phrase """"The program has three “rotations”—classic, lean, and doubles"""" said citation needed.  Fast forward a few months, I ended up buying P90x and doing more p90x searches on google when I considered creating my own blog to hold myself accountable.  I saw that the p90x wiki was still saying citation needed for that quite and remembered reading that exactly on Chelsea's blog on her new post.  I then decided to link her site in the middle of the summer.  Now your reasoning was that it was not a reputable source.  First I want to begin by asking what exactly is a reputable source as far as a workout video goes?  I personally know that Chelsea is about as filled with p90x knowledge as anyone possibly could be.  She has been able to answer any question I throw at her immediately about p90x.  She even leads p90x workouts on our campus.  Recently she was talking to me about people who had emailed her questions and mentioned finding her site via wikipedia and thanked her so much for all of her help, .  Lastly I wanted to say that this link has been on the wiki page for about 6 months and has been through just shy of 200 revisions.    I honestly think that taking this link and source away from the wiki article is just hurting potential visitors of the wiki.  As you can probably tell I am very inexperienced with wikipedia, and I probably wasn't supposed to just undo people's edits.  I am sorry I did not contact you here first.  Let me know what you think about all of this, and have a nice day. — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •  12:44, 7 February 2011  :Hi, don't worry about being inexperienced - everyone is at first! I don't know Chelsea, but I don't doubt what you say that she has a lot of knowledge about the P90X, and I'm sure her blog is a great resource for people interested in it. In the real world, as you seem to have found, it may be that her blog can be considered """"reliable"""" and """"reputable"""". On Wikipedia though, our guidelines for what to use as a source are very strict. You can read about them at Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources. Blogs are very rarely considered """"reliable"""" enough to use in articles here. They are often self-published sources, meaning that somebody writes something and publishes it themselves, for example on their blog or website.

Really, the block should be restored, not because I'm married to it, but because you undid it while knowing you were flying in the face of the rules on the use of admin tools. In broad terms, you can't claim baiting as a defense to personal attacks.  You are always responsible for what comes out of your keyboard. Lord knows I ddon't want to see Malleus leave (or be kicked off) the project, WP:NPA is policy, and no personal attack is ever helpful to our goals here. Lets recap yesterdays timeline.  Malleus was asked to remove his attack.  He refused.  It was removed from AN, he reverted, removed again, and he reverted it back in again.  I actually went to Malleus' talk page yesterday to remind him of the Civility Enforcement case, and to please stop this, then I noticed the refused request, and the edit warring. If this isn't a case of a time where blocking for NPA is justified, then there may as well be no such situation, and the policy of NPA needs to be seriously adjusted (I'm not a huge fan of personal attack blocks, in 90,000+ admin actions, I believe this is the first one I've ever made, but eventually they can be necessary.)  Malleus' block log, we had a chart in the evidence of the Civility case, you may want to look through it, the blocks on him are neither all good or all bad, my rough feeling from reading that evidence was that it fell at about 60/40, but only one or two of the blocks were actually outlandishly bad.

""" Worst Season ever Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back.

Thank you.This is a highly improper blocking by Jehochman, which is abusive and overkill which clearly demonstrates Jehochman's interested take on my editorship, which by Wiki guidelines should mean that this is handed off to an uninterested admin, without blocking.  This block should be reversed if for nothing else to allow me to respond.  This stems from myself asking an admin why I was blocked, a block which was overturned on its merits.  I was asking the blocking admin, what my actions where that caused the blocking.  Gwen Gale never asserted that she was being uncomfortable, that she took this as anything except related to her admin function, and never even hinted she felt harassed in any way.  Further my interactions with her were above board, polite, and on topic.  Jehochman indefinite block is uncalled for, and should be rescinded, either by himself doing the right thing, or by review on meritsFurther details:1.  Toddst1 is a common associate with Gwen Gale, whom was an interested party in reviewing her blocking of me.  That block was reviewed by an uninterested admin who rejected the block.   Toddst1 was the first to suggest there was a problem with my interactions with Gwen Gale in asking for clarification.  My question on the block, related in part to his review of the block, making him very interested in my questions of the merits of the block.   Toddst1 should have never been the review for a Gwen Gale 2. Jehochman is an interested admin with whom I have had interactions with on this topic, and with Gwen Gale at the same time.   This history is ample bias, and goes far in explaining the overkill usage of an indefinite ban.3. Jehochman without acknowledge our history, assesses my editing as not productive.  My edits remain in place in live articles, and my contributions are needless dismissed.  Allowing an indefinite ban to be support by these charges by an interested admin, are wholly unfair.4. Jehochman asserting he can not reference in any manner what are the causes of why my edits have been a BLP violation is a complete farce.  This is the exact issue which occurred the last time, and for which I was never given any explanation.  LETS BE CLEAR, any concerns or issues can be raised in a manner that does not cause a furthering of a BLP issue.  Making generalized statements is not a stretch, and there is no reason why they should not be offered, as explanation to what is going on.  It is my asking for explanation which is at the center.  How can meritorious request for explanation become the object for a indefinite ban???5. Jehochman breaks protocol and request that other admins communicate with him, via email.  There is no reason why Jeochman action as admin should not be done via the normal Wiki process of openness.6. Jehochman is an associate of Dave1185.  Dave1185 is who Jehochman seems to be referring to as warning me.  Dave1185 fashions himself as some sort of vigilante.  He began by entering items on my talk page, then asserting I was harassing, then writing on Gwen Gales page that I was harassing, then bragging to Gwen Gale that I was indefinitely blocked.  After I was block Dave1185 returns to my Talk page, deletes content, and puts his Vigilante signature on it.  you bag'em, we tag'em~!  I am being gamed by Dave1185, and its improper to give an indefinite block based upon this kind of chicanery.   Dave1185 changing of my TALK page after instigating a block on me, is some sort of victory dance, that is clearly improper.Summary: The indefinite block of me for reasonably asking the original block admin for the reasons why I was blocked is improper and uncalled for.  Gwen Gale is capable of speaking for herself and doing it direct to me.  Toddst1 is an interested admin who's actions were rejected by an uninterested admin.  Jehochman and I have a history, and his blocking of me, based on the urgings of Dave1185 of me is not proper.  The usage of an indefinite ban is clear overkill, and demonstrates Jehochman's prior involvement where this matter should have been handed off to another admin to review and for an uninterested admin to take or not take any action.I request this indefinite ban be lifted, for the merits above.  Asking an admin whose block was overturned, for information as to what caused the original block....should not be CAUSE for an indefinite block.  That is what has happened.SEE: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Gwen_GaleNotes on the above page which Jehochman justifies his indefinite block:  1. My request is reasonable and polite.   2.

Why was ANY comment even necessary once I was already blocked, especially from the involved editor/admin who asked you to do it? I never said or even implied that everyone else was at fault; I apologized multiple times for sounding too harsh with the editor who's been adding the questionable content. Beyond that, my primary goal was to get this massive problem solved; massive because of how many articles are involved. I am in no way alone in my feelings on this issue. The large number of editors who have reverted the editor over the past four years is clear evidence of the objections. And now, Dennis is finally acknowledging that I am right on the content issue. He could have, and should have, just said that from the beginning so the other editor would hear it from someone who is very experienced about what is and isn't appropriate. Then we could've proceeded in an appropriate manner to """"fix"""" the problem in the many articles involved. This is why I wrote to admin Mark Arsten in the first place. 76.189.121.57  15:34""",0

The judge may feel the decision needs to be overturned due to more sophisticated legal reasoning. Such a judge may wish to help the law evolve by ruling against precedent and thereby indirectly inducing a losing party to appeal. The appeal court will then have an opportunity to review the lower court's decision and may adopt the lower court's reasoning, thereby overturning previous case law. This may also happen several times as the case works its way through intermediate appellate jurisdictions.Would it be an idea to provide an example?

"""I agree that Raven has has a lot to do with the sucess of this group. I really do. But I also think that keeping the girl in Walt Disney Records was a bad choice for a debut album. Walt Disney Records is obviously going to cath much mainstream attention, with the exception of the soundtracks of the CG movies and HSM.I also think that adding another girl for the movie would be a good idea, but not to the group, unless it invloves a reality show. The show would catch some attention for the girls, even if it failed and could possibly boost them more than they even are.I also think that them opening an official MySpace page did something too. A lot of people access MySpace and they could attract more fans that way.Also, I have been wondering if you noticed at all the Cheetah Sisters: Barcelona Mix on the Cheetah Girls 2 soundtrack. If you have a chance, listen to that song for me. It does not include Raven. It was re-recorded for this soundtrack. There are also rumors of a Greatest Hits album to be in the works after their Hollywod Records debut is avalible for some time. And since, they re-recorded Cheetah Sisters as an actual group, without Raven, I am asuming that if a Greatest Hits album does eventually come along, it will be full of re-recorded material that does not include Raven. If you also bought the Cheetah Girls Party's Just Begun Tour book, you will see that there is a photospread in there, and one of the pictures originally containted Raven.Look on the main page for this group and find their picture. That image has been photoshopped. In that version, used to promote the tour and the soundtrack, they made it look as if they were all standing together originally. They weren't. Raven was standing in between of Adrienne and Sabrina. In the book, a picture from that same photoshoot was included and the lyrics to Strut replaced Raven's body.I think that Hollywood Records is making it very clear that raven has nothing to do with The Cheetah Girls and probably never will again. I can also assume that the girls not want to have anything to do with her...well, they do not want to be tied to her. Raven has said that she is done with Disney after her """"Adventures in Babysitting"""" remake, since she does not want to be tied down to """"a kid franchise"""". I am assume that this upset Disney and now their are rumors of Raven being dropped from Hollywood Records and moved to Arista Records, which would explain the delay in her album release.All I know is, Raven is not part of The Cheetah Girls.

"""Dear Mr. Kohl,I was in touch with James Boros at the time of the """"Complexity Forum"""", and he communicated his dissatisfaction with the results in no uncertain terms.  Richard Barrett in a published interview alluded to this affair, believing the rejection of his article was owing to bias.  What is more, practically no major younger figures of the New Complexity were included among the published articles, whereas, for instance, Erik Ulman, who is a very fine composer but not a New Complexity composer, was included. Whatever the reasons for the choice of articles, the failure to include major younger figures associated with the New Complexity seriously skewed this entire """"Forum.""""Secondly, I would beg you to not play childish games by removing composers I have posted. You have done fine work on Stockhausen, but you are by no means an expert on the subject of New Complexity. I have not seen a single article of yours focusing on this subject. I have never seen you at any of the festivals in which numerous works of younger composers associated with the New Complexity were performed, such as the bludenzer tage of the 1990's of the Züricher Tage of the early 1990's.  Why would you dare to remove Wolfram Schurig, co-editor of the primary book series focused on the New Complexity, leader of the bludenzer tage in its most daring period, and composer commissioned by leading ensembles throughout Europe?  If you don't know anything about him, this reflects badly on your claim to be an expert in this field.  Why would you remove Klaus K. Hübler, whose influence on New Complexity composers is clearly stated in multiple articles in the New Music and Aesthetics in the 21st Century series. Marc André has received numerous prestigious awards and commissions, and his work has also been closely associated with New Complexity; one need only read his articles appearing in the New Music and Aesthetics series to find support for this assertion.I would strongly suggest that you do your homework in this field before you go about arbitrarily altering the contributions of others.  You could begin by going through the first six volumes of the New Music and Aesthetics series, then read numerous articles in Musik & Âsthetik (several references that appeared earlier in this entry have been removed) and works by Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf and others.  Then visit several dozen festival in Europe over an extended period. Then do some score study, perhaps beginning with the composers whose names you have removed.""",0

"""  ==Important Original Casting Omission?==  In 1958, the jazz vocalist and Broadway veteran Adelaide Hall was cast and signed up to appear in the show and share the lead with Pat Suzuki. Newspaper reference from the Washington Afro American 12 August 1958  -  http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8zsmAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=u_4FAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6535,2933764&dq;=adelaide+hall&hl;=en   I have tried to include this relevant piece of information on the actual Flower Drum Song Wikipedia page. Unfortunately it has been deleted twice by a reader who goes by the name of Wehwalt who appears to feel the information is not relevant. I totally disagree with their opinion, as without this piece of information it is rewriting history, and I believe that is something Wikipedia does not wish to encourage. Surely, by adding this information, it may prompt another reader to expand on the reason why Miss Hall left the cast to return to the UK. I would therefore like to bring this to the attention of WIKIPEDIA. At the moment, the CASTING section in this article does not give a true reflection of all the actors who were originally cast in the roles, thereby I believe it is rewriting history and gives a false impression.   I find it strange that Wehwalt felt the need to edit the heading to my explanation about including this relevant piece of information above. Is it now practice to edit the TALK sections as well?   I have brought this matter to the attention of WIKIPEDIA regarding the omitted mention of Adelaide Hall from the Wikipedia article as it does not give a true reflection of who was originally cast and signed for the production. The matter of Miss Hall leaving the cast could be cited as unknown e.g Adelaide Hall left the cast before the production was staged, reason unknown. Surely that would not confuse any reader who reads the article! The fact that the producer and the director of the show and Rogers and Hammerstein cast Miss Hall in the role is I believe extremely significant. I rest my case.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •     :Eurovisa, please sign your talk page messages by adding four tildes to the end of the message like this:~~~~.  That will automatically add your name and a date/time stamp.  I will comment on your proposals at the bottom of the page.      I have no great objection to what you originally wrote so long as you are able to cite the second part of it. The way you had it the second time left the question of her participation in the play hanging. I think it would make a very useful addition to the article. But everything must be cited. Regarding the synopsis I think changing the part about being a girl as you propose would be overly stiff. The synopsis is written in a more popular tone then the rest of the article as I think of the typical reader as someone who is going to the theater and it's hastily reviewing the plot in advance of seeing it for the first time. But certainly we can discuss all these things.     :Regarding the format my colleague Ssilvers can speak to this better than I thought I believe it's dictated by convention at WP:MUSICALS. However some variation had to be made due to the fact that we have two different plots over 40 years apart. This article is about the play; the film has its own.

However, I feel that the decision to keep a POV version in addition to an NPOV version amounts functionally to the same as creating a POV fork.) That is certainly not a reason to keep the latter. Re. #2 & #3: I assume you're talking about WP:SIZE. There is absolutely no reason to be worried about that: WP:SIZE is not a policy, but a guideline, so it the statement """"itis agaisnt wikipedia policy"""" is simply wrong. The guideline says: """"Readers may tire of reading a page much longer than about 6,000 to 10,000 words"""". The article body currently has 935 words, so we're not even close by any stretch of the imagination.  Even if we were close, the guideline specifically says: No need for haste. Even if we were beyond the recommandation, there are many other ways to split articles. Splitting it by POV is not the way to do it.  In conclusion, I am not convinced by any of the arguments; I don't see any benefit for Wikipedia if we kept the """"... LTTE"""" article.  Since this is not an official mediation, and since the three opposing editors have not applied for WP:SLR membership, I have no mandate or obligation to represent them. Nevertheless, I want to regard their needs. The fact that we see some unconvincing arguments could indicate that there are other, unexpressed, needs which the """"... LTTE"""" article satisfies. If that is the case, then there could be more at stake than just a harmless redirect. If that is the case, then I recommend bringing it up on WP:AFD. —  """,0

"""ConsensusWith regard to your statement: """"Regarding the mediation, this would appear to be a situation of a few editors dissenting with a large consensus. Am I correct about that?"""" I think it's about right, but does need to be qualified. Some editors, like Matt Britt and Seraphimblade, still do strongly support the binary prefixes (but, to their credit, never edit warred over them). There was, however, an emerging consensus to allow the use of parenthetical disambiguation alongside legacy prefixes, as opposed to replacing them with binary prefixes. I'm convinced a workable solution can be devised if the edit warring stops. In my opinion, Sarenne's role in all this has been highly counterproductive, though I am also guilty to an extent for participating in an ongoing edit war. *** Crotalus *** """,0

The VELA deployment involved a significant number of Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships, the Royal Marine Commandos and helicopters.[14] The Task Group included HMS Albion, HMS Ocean, HMS Southampton, HMS Argyll, RFA Wave Knight, RFA Mounts Bay, RFA Sir Bedivere, RFA Fort Austin, HMS Enterprise, RFA Diligence, RFA Oakleaf, Mine Counter Measure Squadron 1 and a Fleet submarine together with the Fleet Lead Commando Group, consisting of 40 Commando Royal Marines, 59 Commando Independent Engineering Squadron, 29 Commando Royal Artillery and 539 Assault Squadron Royal Marines.

"""*  *  *I look at a lot of articles (such as BillCJ and many others and it reminds me of books that were published in the 1950 - lots and lots of facts boring, dull uninteresting pictures - picture with no history surrounding what is being published.  In the 1980-90's, a lot of True Aviation historians (i.e. Roger Freeman, Jeff Ethell, Warbirds Worldwide, etc..) found that aviation historians wanted and needed history recorded.  The captions of their books detailed who, what, when, where, etc...  As we progressed into the 2000's, I am finding that today’s writers unfortunately, want to dumb down the article - instead of giving all the details to allow the readers to decide how much level of detail he wants - Again, unfortunately, BillCJ (as well as others) want to take the Dick & Jane approach to aviation history.This is suppose to be an online reference/encyclopedia - often when you Google an item, the wiki article is the first reference to pop-up so this will be (unfortunately) the first and only reference many will have for a subject.  A subject has to include everyone that references and item, whether it be a 4 year old doing his first model airplane, the aviation historian, the F-16 Buff.  These articles are also used by serious models who want the details.Articles only tell part of the story - you need the pictures to compliment and point out what the article is discussing.  In the same vein, the pictures need the same level of detailed study (if possible) and care that is place in creating the entire article.  Having a great and fantastic article (such as the F-16) with kindergarten captions makes the entire article pointless.It is also unfortunate that other editors like Askari Mark feels that detailed captions are meaningless to most readers - again, you can not have an online reference/encyclopedia without filling crossing the t and doting the i's.  Without detailed captions, it like having no reference section - sure you can print captions that state """" Gee an F-16 in Flight """" - especially when it is clear that the airplane is sitting on the ground.  Or the case of one article """"Aircraft is on a bomb-run"""" when it was clear from the picture that the bomb-bay doors were closed, no guns in the waist position and the detailed history showed the aircraft actually was a trainer and never left the United State...BillCJ also mentioned """" are you seriously suggesting that """" serious historians """" only read WP articles for the pictures? """" - it is a proven fact that 90% of all information processed by humans come from Visual"""" data (i.e. pictures, etc...) - this is the reason Picture books are popular with preschoolers.  The first thing a majority humans look out when reading any thing is the pictures - if the pictures are interesting then many people will stop and read.  If an aviation historian comes across an article that details the subject matter then he will stop and read the contents.It is also been said that this article is not for the F-16 Buffs - if this is the case, then  why have technical specifications why have details on each variation??   Why have the nuts and bolts of each individual user?? Etc, Etc, Etc...Why have detailed information regarding anything regarding the aircraft if this subject is not going to reach out to those who can say yes, this is true (i.e. the historian/buff) - If you are going to have the nuts and bolts in the article then you have to carry this same thought patterns over to have the nuts and bolts details in the photo captions.... (for example: B-52 Specifications, B-52 Costs, B-52 Variants) etc...  this type of informations IS for the Aviation Historian / Buff and generally not for the casual reader (which is MY point in having detailed captions).If we dumbdown the photocaptions for the """"causual reader, then this level of details Specifications, costs, variations also needs to be removed as it will only confuse the """" casual reader """" and will lead to people calling all such information """" gobbledy-gook """".If we dumbdown the photocaptions or call detailed information """" gobbledy-gook to most readers """" then terms such as: Wing area, Airfoil, Zero-lift drag coefficient, Drag area, Aspect ratio, Maximum speed:, Combat radius:, Ferry range, Service ceiling ,Rate of climb, Wing loading, Thrust/weight, Lift-to-drag ratio are """"gobbledy-gook to most non-aviation readers""""BillCJ has also mentioned that Wiki is not the place for F-16 Buff's to write article - This is complete opposite what the founders of wiki wanted when this project (wikipedia as a whole) dreamed many, many years ago - Wiki w",0

"""::::You're assuming far more about my views than I've actually said. I have two related points. First, that the topic in question is not necessarily bound to an adherence to the concept of self-reported identity, and that to do so is unencyclopaedic. Second, that it is absurd to assert the logical invalidity of all other definitions of the word """"man"""" but that based on self-reported identity.I agree that the example is conceptually difficult. My view is that a range of interally consistent interpretations of that situation are possible, such that the choice betweeen these arguments cannot be made on a strictly logical basis. The arguments must admit of some strictly non-deductive premises (adductive, inductive etc.) It should be clear then that I'm certainly not advocating a """"definitive, binary and absolute"""" definition of """"man"""". And my reference to Wittgenstein is based upon his fundamental recognition that any word is a """"social construct""""; indeed it is precisely because of this that Wittgenstein argues that nothing that is exclusively self-defined (such as his example of the 'beetle' in the box) can have meaning. To conclude, whilst there legitimate arguments for doing so, we don't have to """"wade into the mud"""" of self-identity, and basic encylopaedic principles demand that.  """,0

Also, remember that this is a page about Nancy Pelosi and not about Turkey and and the Armenian Genocide.  """"give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue""""? This is not the POV by Nancy Pelosi or US House of Representatives Committee, but a tragic event recognized by the most of democratic societies and countries.

YOu are an armenianorigin person. Andranik indeed has been one ot he heads of the bloody Armenian militia killing Turks, Kurds and Azeris, with his terrorist acts has been the reason for the reaction of Kurds, Turks and Azeris after they returned from the war in 5 fronts. So your response is absolutly biased, because of your nationality and firm belief in an event that never occured or occurded only for the Armenian church who uses this so called armenian genocide to mobilzie armenians and prevent their assimilation.

It would in fact be very easy to improve a great deal of Wiki Philosophy articles by just having editors sum up information from this wonderful free, peer-reviewed, academically rigorous resource.Then, withouit provocation, after I asked her what exactly she found problematic about including Nietzsche in a list of philosophers who have written about Happiness, including similar statured luminaries like Augustine, Aquinas, Aristotle, Mill, etc. she responded, not by listing what was wrong with my Happiness edit, but by telling me """"ALL OF YOUR EDITS ARE POOR, PURE AND SIMPLE.

Since I hate to see a poor soul suffering under the weight of such crushing temptation, I gave in to the temptation myself, and deleted all of my contributions from this encylopedia. Within hours, a throng of rebellion began to emerge,. a grass-roots protest movement which demanded the immediate return of all the much-loved Kingshowman edits to the encylopedia. Editors rushed to my defense. I told Flyer22 to eat crow and admit that, contra her opinion, my Hume edits and contributions to this beloved tome of knowledge were not so poor after all. She declined and escalated her attacks.

On """"BYOB,"""" the chorus is extremely pop-like (from an alternative rock POV) and says """"Everybody's going to the party have a real good time, Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine"""" which is an incitation to dance and """"move with the beat"""". On """"Lost in Hollywood"""", one part says """"All you bitches put your hands in the air"""" which is another incitation to """"moving with the beat"""" and is sounds like something a rapper would say (that's my opinion).Nu metal guitarists generally make liberal use of palm muting. - SoaD uses a lot of palm muting. First examples that pop up to my mind are """"BYOB"""", """"Radio/Video"""", and """"Old School Hollywood"""".Another common technique with nu metal guitarists is the use of de-tuned strings whose lower pitch creates a thicker, more resonant sound. - A technique that SoaD uses. """"BYOB"""" is in Dropped C (I believe), but anyone with the slightest guitar knowledge would notice that SoaD are tuned down.This is typical of nu metal bands in that guitar solos are rare in nu metal songs in general, and when they do appear they are often short. - SoaD have very few guitar solos, and if they do they are extremely short or do not emphasize on technicality (which, in general, is what most metal bands do in a guitar solo).Nu metal bands often feature aggressive vocals that range from melodic singing akin to pop and rock, guttural screaming and shouting from various forms of metal, hardcore punk, and rapping. - SoaD uses (most of the time) melodic singing and shouting, and in some occasions uses some rap-like vocals (most notably in their """"Chop Suey"""" intro and verses). Although it is not, properly speaking, rap, the link must be considered. I would still like to remind you that rapping does not necessarily make you a nu metal band, and that being a nu metal band does not necessarily means you rap. There are nu metal bands who don't rap, and they are still nu metal.Normally, nu metal songs have a song structure of instrumental introduction, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, sometimes another verse but almost always ending with a chorus. - This is characteristic of SoaD. Most of their songs (I'm not saying all of them) have a very simple """"verse-chorus-verse"""" structure (as well as the slight variants).It is generally louder in the instrumental parts and the choruses than in the verses. - Listen to """"Attack"""" on their last album.Another thing I'd like to mention is that Serj Tankian worked with Limp Bizkit (a well known nu metal band), Saul Williams (a hip-hop artist), M.I.A. (a rapper), and The Notorious B.I.G. (another rapper & hip-hop artist). The link to hip-hop and rapping with System of a Down's lead singer is therefore established. I don't have the material that Tankian produced with those artists, but seeing how those artists are predominantly hip-hop and nu metal (in Link Bizkit's case), it is probable that the material is similar to hip-hop and nu metal in style. the 'introduction, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge' is used by every genre of music: rock, country, punk, so that doesnt make them nu metal eitherSoaD is nu metal. Cheers Emmaneul (Talk) I feel that the only reason they were labeled as Nu Metal is because all of the hard/metal music that was popping up around that time was following Korn and adding the Hip Hop element. Because they happened to play music that was more hard or agressive than a rock band, they were considered Nu Metal.As for the things that  said, I can easily say how they are wrong. When he gives the reference about BYOB, and how that line """"everybody's going to the party have a real good time, dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine."""" That line is metaphorical. BYOB stands for bring your own bombs, going to the party is metaphorical for going to war, blowing up the sunshine in the desert is like dropping bombs in Iraq. So those lines dont have anything to do woth the crowd moving to the beat. The detuned guitar doesnt make nu metal either. metallica did their st anger album in drop c. and almost every hard rock/metal band today uses drop d or lower. the 'introduction, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge' is used by every genre of music: rock, country,",0

"""The titles need not show that the characters are related, all about this is in the articles. You see, the nature of fiction is that it's not necessarily coherent.

While I don't doubt that your edit was in good faith, there were two problems.  *Common Blackbird is a Featured Article, which amongst other things means that everything must be referenced to independent verifiable sources to enable us to verify the facts.  *I looked at the Kosovo article to see if there was a reference there, and there was. At first sight it looked plausible, linked to a website purportedly belonging to an academic. When I read the text, however, it was clearly written from a highly pro-Serbian viewpoint. That makes it unsuitable as a neutral reference, and also suggests that the origin of the name is not universally accepted, since he seems to imply that there is an alternative view that the name is of Albanian origin. The point of his page is to belittle that view.  You are welcome to add the sentence again if you can find an independent neutral reference  -  """,0

"Additional information The following materials are taken from Wyss, James D., and Sandra K. Wyss.  An Archaeological Assessment of Portions of the Red River Gorge, Daniel Boone National Forest, Kentucky.  Archaeological Report No. 1.  Lexington: Ohio Valley Archaeological Research Associates for U.S. Forest Service, 1977.  I have copied extensive amounts of text because no copyright notice is present — it's a case of .    [page 33] Cowan's investigations at the Roger's Shelters (Po-26 and Po-27) and the Haystack Shelter (Po-47A and B) have provided ethnobotanical analyses of materials obtained under more controlled conditions.  Radiocarbon dates from the Roger's Shelters indicate the site was occupied between the fifth and seventh centuries A.D., and Cowan (1976:97-98) postulates a similar timespan [page 34] for the Haystack Shelter occupation.  Plant food remains from the site include six species of nuts (black walnut, butternut, hickory, chestnut, acorn and hazelnut), four species of fruits (pawpaw, sumac, plum and grape), and four or five possible cultigens (squash or pumpkin, bottle gourd, marsh elder, sunflower, and canary grass).  No corn was recovered.  Fragments of cane basketry, prepared bark, and cordage were also collected (Cowan 1976:87-101).[page 36] Cowan conducted limited test excavations at two of the bottomland sites (Po-31 and Po-42) in 1974.  One of these sites (the Martin Site, Po-42) produced roughened surface pootery which is similar to ceramics from the Levisa Fork in the extreme Eastern Mountains (Cowan 1976:73-82)...In 1973, members of the Red River Historical Society and volunteers from the university of Kentucky, Department of Anthropology conducted excavations at Mf-32, a single-component Fort Ancient rockshelter site.  Materials recovered included corn husks, cordage, cut cane, two species of nuts, and shell tempered pottery, in addition to lithic materials.  The depth of the deposit (approximately 10-15 cm) suggested a relatively short-term occupancy (Cowan 1975:101-102).  Unfortunately, the materials from Mf-32 have not yet been analyzed and reported.[page 50] This page notes that Cowan's 1975 survey, undertaken in response to changes in plans for the reservoir, gained stratigraphic information on a multicomponent Archaic site (Po-17) in the valley.  Cowan returned the following year to complete testing at Po-17 and Po-42, and to initiate excavation at Po-47B, a Woodland rockshelter site.  The data recovered from Po-17 confirmed Cowan's 1973 stratigraphic sequence and provided valuable information on the transition between the Late Archaic and Early Woodland cultures in [page 51] the Red River valley (Cowan 1976:ii).  Excavations at the Haystack Shelter (Po-47B), a Late Woodland dry shelter site, uncovered a large quantity of well-preserved organic remains.  Split cane basketry fragments, plant fiber cordage, leather, quids, paleofeces, and numerous plant food remains including both native and exotic cultigens were among the specimens recovered",0

"""Hi, Bogdangiusca. Thanks for blocking me. I mean this from the bottom of my heart. Since I am clearly a child who needs to sit in the corner with a dunce cap on and learn my manners, this is exactly where I should be! So I see your act of blocking me as an act of kindness and consideration for me and for the entire class, which I have obviously disrupted. The teacher, who is always right, has the certain and inalienable right to do just this. Freedom, after all, is a thing which should be ascertained, not by the people, but by the government which rule the people. This is a thing that is agreed upon by all states: monarhcies, socialist states, fascist states republics that have been overtaken by oligarchies, etc. So I cannot do otherwise but to agree that your block is correct. We did have a chance at real freedom here in the U.S.A. at one time. But alas, it was doomed from the start by those who would steal it to ensure their own freedom and not that of us the people.I do have a question, though. May I ask why you blocked me now for something that I am accused of doing yesterday? Why did you not block me yesterday? duck talk """,0

"""At the top of this section Funkynusayri said """"this article should rather be called Nordic race with Nordic supremacy theory as a sub-section of it"""". That's not an objection to merging, it's an argument in favour of merging, with one aspect contained within another in the same article. We all know that there was historical concept of a 'Nordic race'. No-one disputes that. The question is whether there is any point having a separate article about it, distinct from the cultural and ideological uses to which it has been put. If both can managably be contained in the same article, then they should be. The Mediterranean race article contains both aspects, and so should this one. The title is rather a separate question. Nordic theory is a name that was created by user:fastfission to merge the term Nordic race with the idea that the concept became historically significant because there were specific theories about it. After all, that's what makes this page different from the others. This topic has a long, sometimes acrimonious, Talk page. If you look up Mediterranean race there is far less discussion, and there is almost none on Alpine race or Dinaric race. I don't mind what the title is, but the difference in title does reflect the reality that theories about this issue have been historically and ideologically significant, while theories about other European """"sub-races"""" have been purely academic.

You closed the pawn deletion discussion with delete citing lack of sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Pawn_%28scripting_language%29  But I listed at least two WP:RELIABLE sources, and updated the article with them. And an editor previous voting for delete changed it's vote to keep after seeing that. All the delete votes were cast before I edited the original article with the new sources. There was no lack of sources (IMHO) nor consensus for deletion. Please review your decision.     *Are these the same sources you gave in the AFD where two very experienced editors still voted to delete afterwards?  '   ** That was in 2 April. After Neutrality voted delete I went again to search for more sources and posted them in 5 April. Piotrus aparently didn't even read any of that, as it said """"Self-published (creator's website) references only"""". Then I went to update the article itself. After that Be..anyone changed his vote. The other two didn't apear again to say if they changed their opinion or not after that.     ***I didn't pick up on that - probably because your comment included  I included some of the sources I listed above in the discussion. What were the additional sources you referred to? I will review them and see if that should have changed the outcome.  '   **** I think you can see the history of the article. The main ones were the Dr. Dobbs article and the page in that book (that is a real mainstream printed book where it costs to them to add one extra page). And also the notable software/games that use/used it. In the deletion page I also listed lots of evidence that it is widely used by many groups unrelated to the language authors, as an informal pledge for notability, to show it is not a pet project or commercial spam.     **** Any update?     **I wouldn;t accept DrDobbs as a reliable source - from their 'about' page the articles in DDJ are often written by the readers of DDJ and the author of that article is not on their staff. I found a copy of the 1st edition of the book online and couldn't find a reference to the subject. Obviously its not the second edition, but if all you have is that it won't be enough.  ''''   *** Even if not written by their staff, it is revised and published by them, and they have proven themselves as a reliable source over the years. As for the book, you can find searching for Pawn on google books  *** And now a little rant: It is a programming language, not a politician. The pawn manual is probably the most reliable and extensive source on the language, being extended and revised for over a decade. And right behind are the wiki pages I linked on the forks, that were likely written by the fork developers itself and maybe with little corrections from the users. Of course they fail the general wikipedia guidelines for reliability as primary/self published/user generated, but common sense indicates that they are probably reliable for technical matters. Wikipedia kinda recognizes that in WP:SELFSOURCE. The reason for disallowing self published content is that """"Anyone can create a personal web page or publish their own book, and also claim to be an expert in a certain field"""". But someone who created a game engine using this language and supported it and it's relatively large user and developer base for years is not simply """"anyone"""" anymore, even if he isn't a distinguished academic.  *** The problem here was mainly notability. Is it self promotional cruft that was never adopted by anyone besides their creators and thus would not merit a encyclopedic article? Or is it a language with maybe thousands of developers, recognized by github, that sparked not one, but two children, used by gamming modding comunities and WP:NO 	 LE games alike? A mainstream programming book could afford pay a page to feature it, but an article in wikipedia would make it an worse online encyclopedia? Yeah, the strictly WP:RELIABLE references are on the low side, but I think it is reasonable to argue that the existence of this article wouldn't make wikipedia worse, but better, especially after my edits to it. And I wasn't the only one thinking that way in the deletion discussion you closed by mistake.  ([[User talk:Caro",0

If Ubuntu Linux ever started going slow, I would need to worry about performing the necessary maintenance that Windows users have to constantly battle with, but so far Ubuntu is running as fast as it did on day one - with no constant maintenance.  So yes, """"Windows needs constant user-help to maintain itself.""""    """,0

"""==Another specific example====Under Genetic explanations, WRN has written this - To support these claims, they often cite several lines of evidence that they interpret as support for a partly genetic cause of group differences in IQ:   1. Black–White–East Asian differences in IQ, reaction time, and brain size are observed worldwide in a range of cultures and environments. In the United States, significant Black-White IQ differences are observable at every age above 3 years, within every occupation or socioeconomic level tested, in every region of the country, and at every time since the invention of ability tests.[106]   2. Jensen and other have argued that the magnitude of race differences on different IQ subtests correlate with the extent to which those subtests measures g,[107] which also correlates with measures of the subtests heritability.[108] From these and other findings, they argue that race differences have a partly biological basis.[109]   3. The rising heritability of IQ with age (within all races; studies have found on average in the developed world heritability starts at 20% in infants, rises to 40% in middle childhood, and peaks at 80% in adulthood); and studies showing the virtual disappearance (~0.0) by adulthood of shared environmental effects on IQ (for example, family income, education, and home environment), with adopted siblings partaking in the studies no more similar in IQ than with strangers[110] From these studies, they argue that most suggested environmental explanations for IQ difference between groups do not have a strong enough effect on IQ to fully account for group differences.4. Studies of US comparisons of both parents to children and siblings to each other finding regression to differing means for different races (85 for Blacks and 100 for Whites) across the entire range of IQs,[111] despite the fact that siblings are matched for shared environment and genetic heritage, with regression unaffected by family socioeconomic status and generation examined[112]This seems to be excessive detail.  WRN has essentially recreated Rushton/Jensen arguments, and placed citations in his citation.  This essentially allows WRN to write an entire section, as if it were incontrovertible based on various references, without any possible response.  The NPOV fact that should be reported is that Rushton and Jensen make some assertions, not that they make some assertions, and here is the factual evidence they use to back it up.  If anything, every one of their """"lines of evidence"""" should be attributed directly to Rushton and Jensen, as much of that same evidence may be interpreted as undermining the """"genetic hypothesis"""", depending on the viewer.  It seems very weaselly, in any case. Can we agree these four points should be removed from the article?  Comments?  ==""",0

Seems you've come a cropper from this template the same way I did.     ==Re:River Song==  Thing is you seem to have misunderstood what I was trying to achieve by altering the prose text on River at Companion (Doctor Who). The idea was, like with the Third Doctor's UNIT friends, to state that she's sometimes considered a companion without asserting that she definitely is. You've changed it to read that she IS a companion, which makes the whole section redundant. If she's in the Eleventh Doctor table, anything else can be expressed through footnotes as with other characters. (Incidentally, the bottom paragraph doesn't read correctly since your edits but I am unable to change as I'm not 100% on what your intended meaning is.)  The problem is, asserting that she's definitely a companion for series 6 presents difficulties. The source only calls her a """"companion"""", it doesn't specify any particular episodes and it's hard to use that to say she's a companion in series 6 but not 5 or 4. But conversely, I don't think anyone considers it correct to call her a companion of the Tenth Doctor. If she's in the table, it means she has to be added to Template:Eleventhdoctorcompanions and the articles for specific episodes, and despite the slight narrative change I mentioned on the project page I don't feel there's really enough to distinguish between series 6 and her previous appearances. That's why I feel that we should leave her off the companions list until she travels with the Doctor properly (for want of a better term).   """,0

"The whole thing about Beth Phoenix was that, there was definitely SOMEONE from the female developmental talent group being released that day, but no one was sure who exactly that was. After Angel was confirmed, people came to the conclusion that since Beth was never brought back to the main program, they assume that she was released too, but this was never well-covered at all until Beth brought it up on her blog.    I disagree with the 'not pretty enough' bit. Most of the current batch of WWE Divas arent even near the league of perfect 10's with their looks. In my opinion she is still arguably prettier then her DSW peers: Nattie, Shantelle, even Krissy. If they can make plain-looking women like Sharmell, Candice (her looks is so overrated), Jillian and maybe Trinity look good, they can do it with anyone. Hell Beth has a pretty face, but a really buff physique and they still signed her. I think its more to do with the fact that she was stuck in developmental hell for way too long, and the fact that her Diva-ed up blonde image hurt her cos they have so many blondes on the roster now. They couldnt come up with anything for her as usual.   Its sad to see gems like her and Shelly being let go while expendable generic women are still employed and focused on. They have so much to offer.",0

""" needs balanced perspective Climate change should be discussed with global warming entry – they are one and the same thing.This has to be a balanced discussion also discussing the forecasts and uncertainties in forecasting temperature / CO2 increase which are proposed as the causes of the examples of climate change that are presented.Discuss the politicization (sp?) of the entire issue, the role of IPCC, of Gore etc.  This is very much at the heart of the attention and emphasis being given.  Discussion of post 1950s warming does not mention the pre 1950s temperature drop that is not explained by the forcings and “predictive” climate models. The forecasts / predictions are major part of the actual basis for the attention and emphasis in the carefully planned publicity campaign of the IPCC.  IPCC readily acknowledges that their role is to expand awareness to provide push for policy makers.  The 90 / 95 / etc. probabilities are without merit, are not based on independent scientific fact but Delphi polling of scientists who are doing the scientific modeling.  In fact, IPCC acknowledge that it is not possible to predict the future trajectory which is why they are developing scenarios not forecasts.  Scenarios assume a set of initial values or base starting points for the forcings and forecast how these forcings will play out over time.  This does not adequately take into account technological change that is and will continue to occur.  None of this is identified and discussed in this entry.In this regard, some analogies with Thomas Malthus """"An Essay on the Principle of Population"""" (1798), [aka """"Malthusian catastrophe, Malthusian crisis, Malthusian dilemma, Malthusian disaster, Malthusian trap, or Malthusian limit (Wikipedia)], Paul Ehrlich """"The Population Bomb"""" (1968), Club of Rome """"Limits to Growth"""" (1972), as well as Orsen Well radio case of H.G. Wells """"War of the Worlds"""" (1936) as an example of how the media can be an  effective force in public opinion.Both in the US and UK court rulings do not allow presenting / discussing the climate change issues without a balanced view of the issues such as mentioned here.  Wikipedia entries should also be required to be required to meet the same standards in presenting balanced views. The need for climate change policy is  based on economic evaluation of the future pattern of costs vs. benefit.  The Stern review – which is discussed – has been strongly criticized in peer reviewed journals because of its assumptions and approaches which very greatly favor support the recommendations, which is neither scientific or intellectually honest.  See e.g., the following references.Nordhaus, WILLIAM  Q., “A Review of the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change,” Journal of Economic Literature Vol. XLV (September 2007), pp. 686–702Weitzman, MARTIN L. “ A Review of The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change,” Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. XLV (September 2007), pp. 703–724Pielke, Roger, Jr. , “Mistreatment of the economic impacts of extreme events in the Stern Review Report on the Economics of Climate Change , Science Direct: Global Environmental Change 17 (2007) 302–310Nordhaus, William D., “Alternative measures of output in globaleconomic-environmental models: Purchasing power parity or market exchange rates?,”  Science Direct: Energy Economics 29 (2007) 349–372  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  You seem to have missed the line at the very beginning: 'for current global climate change see global warming'. Merging them would be like merging the history of the United States with the 2008 presidential election...  The global warming page in the terminology section states that global warming is an example of climate change, a subset as it were. The way these two articles are broken up is completely wrong. 122.104.2.224  How so? Global climate change is purely the projected change of the climate. Global warming is an example of climate change - it is the heating of the climate. However, if temperatures drop, which many people believed before, that too would be global climate change.

""" • email)  yes i did the entire table was a copyvio.  let's take this matter to the talk page   - Talk  Serenity System Map Image That's a pretty nifty piece of work =] what did you use to create it? [reply to my email address asteconnathotmaildotcom, this IP address is my work's one =] thanks ]   Episode naming Hi, Cyberia.  There's actually been a lot of discussion about this subject at Wikipedia:Naming conventions (television) and its talk page.  The consensus of most of the editors there is that articles should be disambiguated only when it's necessary — that is, when there's no other article by that name.  This is why, for example, Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down was moved to that location from Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down (Battlestar Galactica) — there is no other article that could be at that page.  This is in keeping with the general disambiguation guidelines at WP:D, specifically WP:D#Deciding to disambiguate, which says:Ask yourself: When a reader enters this term and pushes """"Go"""", what article would they most likely be expecting to view as a result? (For example, when someone looks up Joker, would they find information on a comedian? On a card? On Batman's nemesis? On the hit song or album by The Steve Miller Band?) When there is no risk of confusion, do not disambiguate nor add a link to a disambiguation page.The argument you give (that using parenthetical phrases consistently keeps articles consistent and makes them easier to identify) has been considered in the debate at WT:TV-NC, but most editors felt that the """"consistency"""" was a misleading virtue, since preemptive disambiguation actually makes articles less consistent with the general Wikipedia naming scheme.  And the article itself should provide enough context to identify it.  The category system also unites articles on a similar topic.The Star Trek precedent is, in my opinion, a bad one; the editors at the Star Trek WikiProject have been informed of the discussion at WT:TV-NC, and it is likely that Star Trek episode articles will also be moved soon.I admit that Resurrection Ship and Cylon resurrection ship are a slightly complicated case, but I think that since the episode is titled Resurrection Ship (with a capital """"S"""") and the ship itself is at Cylon resurrection ship (with no capitals), it's sufficiently clear.  However, if you and other BSG editors feel that it's better to have Resurrection ship as a disambiguation page, with the episode at Resurrection Ship (Battlestar Galactica episode) and the ship at Cylon resurrection ship, that would be OK too. — (talk • contribs) It's been considered.  See the extensive discussion at WT:TV-NC and its archives, especially here. Basically, the argument is that disambiguation isn't about identifying a subject unless there are two articles that might otherwise share the same name.  So it's appropriate for """"The Enemy Within"""" to be disambiguated The Enemy Within (TOS episode), since there are other meanings of The Enemy Within (disambiguation).  But there's no need for Charlie X to be disambiguated, since only the TOS episode has that name. — (talk • contribs) Josiah means """"some"""" editors.. 50% does not equate to """"most"""" Josiah.  (talk contribs count""",0

"""== Art of War ==Thanks for being so understanding.  I hope you decide to stick around.  Regarding The Art of War (disambiguation), there is already a link to Sun-Tzu's book, which El Norte Press has simply issued in a new edition.  WP:DISAMBIG covers the sorts of things that are appropriate for disambiguation pages; since we wouldn't have a whole article on a single edition of a book, we wouldn't mention it on the disambiguation page.  But please feel free to contribute to Wikipedia in other ways.  And (ironic as it might sound now), ignore all rules:  if you do something wrong, someone else will come along and fix it!  ' TalkContribs  Ah, I had missed that you had said Mao's Art of War, not Sun Tzu's.  Still, Mao never wrote a book called The Art of War.  The El Norte Press edition is a compilation of four separate treatises.  They would be notable individually, but none would be linked to the Art of War disambiguation page since none of them shares that title, nor could the El Norte edition be advertised on any of the articles devoted to one of those four treatises (e.g., On Protracted War). ' TalkContribs  There is a difference between editions that on their own satisfy the requirements of WP:N and the insertion of information about a specific edition into articles about a book.  A more specific notability guideline is available at WP:NB.  Since The Art of War (disambiguation) is not a heavily-edited page, leaving this to another editor to correct does not seem likely to resolve this problem.  If you like, you can request a third opinion, which would bring others into the discussion.  ' TalkContribs  Thanks for your note.  While anything written by Mao Zedong would count as notable, a collection of his writings, assembled under a title that he never chose, would not be.  It is for this reason that I am loathe to include The Art of War as one of Mao's writings or to put it on the disambiguation page.  One thing that caught my eye was your claim that this work is referenced in scholarly papers.  That would be a sign of notability.  Did Mao ever publish these works together as unit under the title, The Art of War? Who has discussed the works by this title? ' TalkContribs  Thank you again for your comments.  The fact that this edition appears in the footnote of an unpublished paper does not make it notable; blogs are not reliable sources, either.  You mention that this book is used at West Point.  I would correct you to say that this edition has been ordered by the West Point bookstore; the book in question does not exist — except as a creation of El Norte Press.  You mention your expertise:  expert editors addresses this issue, so we don't have to throw our credentials on the table.  If you wish to pursue this further, the link for a third opinion is above.

"""Quote from Peter Sugar, """"The Early History and the Establishment of the Ottomans in Europe"""": There the Hungarian-Wallachian alliance was still in effect, and Bayezid I now moved against Mircea. Once again, many Christians, mostly Serbs, fought in his army, including Kraljevic (the son of the king) Marko, the hero of another famous Epic, who died not in that battle, but in the Battle of Arges which Bayezid fought with the Wallachians on May 17, 1395. Mircea appears to have been victorious militarily, but his forces and resources were so depleted that he had to acknowledge the loss of the Dobrudja, into which Bayezid moved Turkish garrisons. He also had to accept the status of an Ottoman vassal and pay regular tribute. This arrangement lasted until the Danubian Principalities regained their independence. Although it created problems for the Romanians, it saved them from the much harsher treatment that went with direct Ottoman rule, especially during the centuries of decline.  """,0

However, it is only slightly mentioned through  """"Nai, the Story of a !Kung Woman"""" on how the actual subjects or indigenous tribes react-to and can utilize this film.In order to expand on this topic, I was thinking of a rough statement like this would be ideal:Indigenous tribes and people often have clearly defined practical reasons for participating in ethnographic films.  Such reasons include creating a record of their lives for future generations, warning authorities of potential problems, exchanging cultural information with other cultural groups and educating dominant cultures.Aufderheide, Patricia. Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2007.  An ethnographic film by indigenous creators can also concentrate heavily on a particular movement towards indigenous activism.  The way an activist approach is accomplished is when filmmakers approach the issue with a tactic of openness, which ultimately no longer makes the camera a transparent object and instead an actor on stage that is allowed to be lead by its subjects.Aufderheide, Patricia.

"""Thanks for the support... by the time you added that comment I'd changed the tautology para, and removed all the others so I'm not clear which """"current"""" para you mean. Quite a lot of consilidation done tonight; I'm much happier with the current text than before. From my POV the main remaining problem is the lead paragraph which I hope the current text demonstates is seriously misleading. Here is my proposed new version:In physics and cosmology, the anthropic principle was originally the rule of reasoning that we should take account of the constraints that our existence as observers imposes on the sort of universe that we could observe. The term has since been extended to cover supposed """"superlaws"""" that in various ways require the universe to support intelligent life, usually assumed to be carbon-based, and occasionally to be specifically human beings. Anthropic reasoning involves assessing these constraints by analysing the properties of universes with different fundamental parameters or laws of physics from ours, and has frequently concluded that essential structures, from atomic nuclei to the whole universe, depend for stability on delicate balances between different fundamental forces; balances which only occur in a small minority of possible universes — so that ours seems to be  fine-tuned for life. Anthropic reasoning also attempts to explain and quantify this fine tuning. Within the scientific community the usual approach is to invoke selection effects from a real ensemble of alternate universes; competing strategies, occasionally also called anthropic, include intelligent Design.  This would allow some shortening of the second para discussing controversies. You can see that I plan to have Anthropic reasoning re-direct to this page.  You can also see that I think we should avoid getting hung up on the tautologous nature of some statements of the AP (including the one you like), because I do think that misses the point.(c.f. new first para to the Character of Anthropic reasoning section). Oh, another proposal: merge the Bostrom section into the Variants, i.e. add his self sampling assumption as an AP-type statement. What do you think?  """,0

It remains no violation of WP rules to post from an IP address, particularly if the Cabal is preventing people from correcting an articles errors by any other means.  The Cabal blocks people illegally, so the public is forced to employ other tactics to avoid the Cabal's finagling fingers.  Fortunately, the identities of the Cabal are now (at least, in part) being exposed.  Skomorokh, strangely, is holding back, perhaps fearful of losing control over his high-priority 'assignment'.

As a community, we believe that members who have greater power should use that power to promote consensus and a neutral point of view. When an administrator abuses his or her greater power to promote self interest or personal POV against or without the consent of the community, we believe that member should lose his or her administrative or higher powers. Would you be interested in starting and/or promoting a Wikipedia:No confidence area for the purpose of demoting administrators and above who use their power to push personal POV?In such an area, any editor could call for a show of support or no-confidence for an administrator or higher. People would sign for either support or no-confidence along with examples of the editor in question creating an edict without consensus, or a statement of why they believe the alleged edicts are in line with community consensus. Please feel free to start or add to Wikipedia:No confidence and to duplicate this message or tell other editors who want to see Wikipedia succeed. KIMP (spewage)",0

Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european. Honestly, he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all. 'Stay on your side of the fence', is a motto I always quote.To that, yesterday I followed up by sending emails to Homeland Security and the FBI Counter-terrorism Division for investigation into who he is and what his motives are. (No, I've not gone off the deep end). I received an automatic response email from the FBI stating that they will look into the matter, and will definitley be following up. Racist muslims of this type are tricky and can pose a risk to the US. Also, I sent an email to wiki complaining about this enemy of europeans and americans. I got an email back from wiki stating that he will be reviewed - thank god! His place in wiki - and in the US - shouldn't be secure.",1

""" Re: """"Reverts"""" Hello, Drmargi. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for saying what needed to be said to me, but in a very respectful, sophisticated manner. I've taken the time to review both articles you referenced, especially personal attacks. While what I said was not directed at any specific person, it was in direct conflict with a portion of what constitutes a personal attack. For that, I'd like to apologize. The reason I verbally came out swinging, so to speak, is because of misdirected frustration. There is an individual with whom I had a conflict regarding the episode page of another show, a show about which I'm almost as passionate as I am about Person of Interest, and that very same person if one of those who reverted my edit (mind you, for good reason I now know), however, when this took place on another TV show's page, he was extremely passive aggressive and hostile in his immediate discrediting of my editing abilities. I had just started using Wikipedia at the time and was not very proficient in computational cyber protocol, or even writing code (that is not the case anymore) Please do not misinterpret this, as I know I am the one in the wrong, and I am not trying to engage in a dialogue in which I somehow look like the victim. I just feel as though I needed to explain myself, and who better with whom to do so than the one of 4 users on Wikipedia who have shown me respect and made me feel welcome.I am well aware that the world will not end if the POI Season 5 info is not complete (lol). If I thought the world were to end, I wouldn't be on my computer. But passive aggression aside, I sincerely am a person who loves Person of Interest and Criminal Minds, as they have helped me deal with deep-seeded problems in my own life, as far-fetched as that may sound, so I make it my business to do the best I can to help keep fellow fans as informed as possible, and Wikipedia is an amazing vessel through which to do so. In my mind, I saw how many little error notices Wikipedia has put on the POI episode lists and wondered why my mistake was IMMEDIATELY centered out, but whoever made the mistakes of adding too long of an episode summary, over 40 times, was not reprimanded. However, it is foolish to assume they weren't. I reacted much in disproportion to the situation, and I do not intend to do so again, as I want to respect Wikipedia's rules. I just felt that a specific user had discredited my information for the sole purpose of undermining me. That did, in fact, happen on a page for Criminal Minds and I was the aggrieved party in that case. My information was solid, came straight from a co-executive producer, and yet this person continued reverting it, so I sought help and reported him. However, to think that same scenario applies to this POI conflict... I now see how slanted and nonsensical that is.In conclusion, I will not add information unless it can be traced back to an original source, credible and solid. (like my addition of Fred Toye as director and Andy Callahan as co-writer of POI episode 5-10 - the 100th) I do apologize if I've offended you with my two aggressive edit summaries, as they were the result of misdirected anger and frustration. Thank you for informing me of where I went wrong, and remaining respectful and composed. I love to learn, and I'm glad I've learned more specific information about how to avoid reference/edit info-conflicts. I also want you to know that I'm well aware that Wikipedia is not a fan site. While I intend to show you the utmost respect, that was uncalled for. I can read - very well, in fact. Je peux parler en Français aussi, et je peux le comprendre. I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, that is why I try to be as thorough as possible, and if this sentence comes off as condescending, that is because you offended me as well. I did not insult you, or anyone specifically; what I did was make a childish, anger-driven, juvenile comparison of whoever reverted my edits to royalty, or self-appointed leaders. It was a mistake to do so, and since I'm not very good at conflict resolution - the fact that this is my best attempt to mend fences proves that - I'm going to stop now because I'm starting to argue with my own intentions. Please forgive my outburst, and be assured that it won't happen again. I will continue to help build a stronger Season 5 episode table with solid references, but I fully intend to adhere to the rules and keep my opinions of other editors to myself.Thank you for helping me to stay informed, so that I can continue to inform fellow TV Crime Drama fans. Happy editing and thank you for your kindness and composure in this matter.B. Edward Bef3481(2)   """,0

This is how the entire arguments started.7. The battle of Grengam article is only a mess in his head. Look at it admin, please. I also see that it has been changed into an even better one, after the editing of another user. 8. I request that the user Narking is banned from editing Battle of Poltava and Battle of Grengam if he continues with his annoying, and vandalizing edits. Umm, one word. PROOF. Until you actually have any sort of backing (at ALL), your argument is empty air. And why is not the Ukrainian view allowed? Umm, they were part of the battle, in big time, last time I checked.

"""==October 2007== Dear Leslie fyans, hello, and welcome to Wikipedia! I hope to not seem unfriendly, but I'd like to bring to your attention the conflict of interest guideline which explains the potential incompatibility between the purpose of Wikipedia to produce a neutral, verifiable encyclopedia, and the purposes of an individual editor. Conflict of interest editing often involves contributing to Wikipedia in order to promote yourself, your friends or family, or the interests of other individuals, companies, or groups you are closely associated with. When an editor disregards the aims of Wikipedia to advance outside interests, they stand in a conflict. Please review this guideline, and you may wish to also review the notability guidelines as well. Thank you for your interest in Wikipedia, and I hope you'll find many helpful areas! Sincerely, Ariel:heart_suit:Gold Hi Leslie, I'm placing this here for your review, as your submission to articles for creation was specifically about yourself. Also please see Wikipedia:Autobiography, along the same lines. Normally if you are notable enough, reliable, third-party sources will exist, and an article will have been written. If you are notable (again refer to the notability requirements), but the article does not exist, you may request it, but either way, you should not edit an article about yourself, as explained above, as it would be quite difficult to remain neutral, which is one of the core policies of Wikipedia. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Thanks! Ariel:heart_suit:Gold """,0

"""===Canada===In Canada, following consultation with all major religious groups, the Divorce Act was amended in 1985 to add Section 21.1 to give the courts have the power to dismiss any application, and strike out any pleadings and affidavits filed by a spouse who has failed to remove religious barriers to the remarriage of the other spouse. The legislature intended to:place spouses on a more equal footing in civil divorce actions;encourage women in particular to exercise fully their rights under the law; andmaintain the integrity of the Divorce Act 1985 by helping to ensure that refusing to accept or to give a religious divorce was not used as a bargaining tool to gain unfair concessions on child custody and access, or monetary support. This reflects a general strong response at a federal level to any elements of duress or undue influence within the civil law system.Bruker v. MarcovitzThe justiciability of a civil contract with religious overtonese is now being tested in the Supreme Court Case of Bruker v. Marcovitz. See Canadian Civil Liberties Association. http://www.ccla.org/pos/legal/In 1969, the parties married in an orthodox ceremony.  During the next 11 years they adopted two children after Ms. Bruker was unable to conceive.  In April of 1980, Ms. Bruker initiated divorce proceedings.   A link to the decision database is http://www.jugements.qc.ca/ and the full decision can be found with a text search for “Bruker” under “Cour d’appel”In 1980, Mr. Marcovitz agreed upon a consent judgment for the divorce to appear immediately before Rabbinical authorities for the purpose of granting the religious Get.  Shortly, after the civil divorce, Ms Bruker, personally and through various attorneys and Rabbis, asked Mr. Marcovitz to provide the get, but Mr. Marcovitz refused. Mr. Marcovitz opined that he refused to comply because he viewed Ms. Bruker's behavior since the divorce as harassment and an attempt by her to alienate him from his children.  Ms Bruker sued Mr. Marcovitz in 1989, seeking damages in the amount of $500,000 """"for having been restrained from going on with her life since de Decree Nisi [...], for having been restrained to remarry according to the Jewish faith [and] for having been restricted of having children"""". Marcovitz vs. Bruker (500-09-013353-032; September 20, 2005)In 1995, a certificate of divorce was issued by the Rabbinical Court of Montreal with Mr. Marcovitz's consent and participation to the get.  Despite receiving the get, Ms Bruker amended her action to increase the amount of the damages claimed to $1,350,000 and to include damages """"for the loss of consortium."""" Since Mr. Marcovitz was in breach of a judgment of the civil court, the lower court found that the matter could be argued before the civil courts and that Mr. Marcovitz had breached his contractual obligation to """"appear before Rabbinical Authorities.  He awarded Ms. Bruker $47, 500 in damages.On appeal, Justice Hilton, writing for the three member court, overturned the lower court judgement.  The appellate court ruled that the obligation was religious in nature and so could not be judged by the civil courts. """"It matters not that the obligation was stated in the Consent that the Superior Court ratified, since the Superior Court could never have entertained an application for corollary relief under section 17 of the Divorce Act to require the issuance of a ghet. It is not at all unusual to see the parties in an agreement on corollary relief undertake to perform a variety of obligations that are not, strictly speaking, obtainable independently, but which are desirable nevertheless to the extent that they promote an amicable post-divorce environment.""""""""While I recognize the usefulness of the inclusion of obligations of this nature in divorce agreements, it does not follow that they all automatically become subject to curial supervision and control, whether for specific performance or damages in the event of a breach.

Nonetheless, my alumnus journal says that profs have already had to lower the standards of core courses and eso-bso courses because quota students don't have the background or prereqs to pass the courses as they stood. It's really quite tragic as it would severely compromise the quality of students coming out of the IIT's.",0

Worst. Article. Ever.This article is the worst I've seen in a long time. It should be rewritten by someone who knows what they are talking about eg. actually gynocologists. The photo should be removed as it is not representative of normal women. It seems very small and I wonder if it is even an adult woman as it doesnt even have any pubic hair at all. Failing that more photos of what normal/natural more average women look like should be added.

"WP:MOSMED is the Manual of Style for articles that come under any of the Medical categories. All medical-related articles have to comply to reach Good Article (GA) or above (hehe - I only found out about it at the second GA Review!).Try typing 'Paul Bert' into the search box in the left column of any page and click the 'Search' button (rather than pressing Enter or clicking the Go button). You'll get the search results - the article Paul Bert is first, and Oxygen toxicity is fourth. If you click the Go button instead, you go direct to the article if it exists, otherwise you get the search results as before. Try the same test searching for 'Paul Bert effect'.There is an article on Decompression sickness - we plan to tackle that after we have finished getting Nitrogen narcosis to GA. No need to mention those in Oxygen toxicity - although all of them are summarised in Scuba diving#Effects_of_breathing_high_pressure_gas.The partial pressure of oxygen is the trigger for OxTox: that is found by multiplying the fraction of oxygen by the ambient pressure at the depth you're at. For example, air is 21% oxygen and the pressure at 50 metres is 6 bar. So you have a partial pressure of oxygen (ppO2) of 0.21 x 6 = 1.26 bar. That's safe from CNS OxTox as it's never been observed at less than 1.3 bar. Divers may use gas mixtures different from air, however - take a look at Nitrox for more information.It's my pleasure to try to explain where I can. I must admit it was a little mischievous of me to throw you in at the deep end on Oxygen toxicity . But believe me, the discipline needed to meet all the style requirements is a great learning experience and worth the effort.

"""Excellent points about some of the other very important events in history! Reportedly, Columbus kidnapped a handful of natives and brought them back to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain. Whether or not he was abusive toward them aboard ship remains undecided. Some say he was kind to them (according to his journal!) while others say differently. At any rate, with the order of Isabella and Ferdinand, the thousands upon thousands of Spanish Conquistadors who invaded America, and Columbus, himself, did basically cause the destruction of many of the New World Mongoloids (whose ancestors had crossed the land bridge from Asia to America many centuries before). How strange is Mankind? Two centuries before Columbus, the Mongoloids were responsible for the destruction of many Europeans (especially Eastern Europeans) during the Mongol Empire. Later, it would be the Europeans causing the destruction of many of the New Word Mongoloids in America. It's like Ghengis Khan = Christopher Columbus (with a special nod to Isabella and Ferdinand).

"May 2011 (UTC)It would be difficult to classify tools based on both their intended and unintended purpose, but at the same time screw drivers are very frequently misused to pry open containers of paint.I haven't found any source classifying (or even defining well enough to make a category) tools either. I think we might be best off creating our own definitionnot in the sense of original research, but purely for the purpose of better organizing the encyclopedia. Here's a thought (just a rudimentary idea): let's say there are passive and active tools. Passive tools create no tangible effectthese are measuring devices, ladders, flashlights, stools, clamps (unless they are used for crushing), jacks, beakers, tape recorders(?). Active tools have a tangible effect: drills, pencils, hammers, nail clippers, spatulas, shovels. In general tools act on a material (although not necessarily a specific material, like a flashlight will act on most things): pencils act on paper, egg beaters act on eggs, saws on wood or metal, caulk guns on caulk, paint brushes on paint, beakers on chemicals. So consider a container of correction fluid: the little brush on the inside of the lid is the active tool, the container is the passive tool and the whiteout is the material.

Can I first point out that Jake Bostwick is a former UCMMA middleweight champion and currently the UCMMA welterweight champion? UCMMA is, along with BAMMA and Cage Warriors, the biggest MMA promotion in the United Kingdom. Secondly, after glancing over WP:MMANOT and WP:ATHLETE, I see that they are indeed guidelines. Now I may be cut from a different cloth from you two in terms of how we see what a guideline is but to me, a guideline is optional when it comes to following it, meaning that they cannot be used in AfDs as the sole reason why to delete any article. Thirdly, I have spent much time working on the page (as well as being the creator of the page), I have found very strong sources from websites such as The Sun, The Mirror as well as finding information that goes beyond it from being a 'typical' mixed martial artist's Wikipedia page, as it has information about him being on a reality tv show called Party Wars, and being the headline of an article in which he got into issues with the police for his tactics whilst working as a Wheel Clamper only strengthens his notability. The very sources on him alone helps him pass WP:GNG, which is all you need to pass a page on Wikipedia in my opinion.I would welcome constructive ideas about improving the page even more, but to talk about deleting the page without informing me first of this discussion I find is a bit disrespectful towards me, however I fairness to you we haven't exactly known each other for a while, so now I have adding myself to the topic and given the facts of the page's position on Wikipedia, now we can talk to help improve the page even more.    User:Pound4Pound Since you filed the SPI, I wanted to update you that I've reversed the block.  I requested another editor to review the case, and while there are a lot of coincidences, he felt it was borderline enough based on behavior, that the block should be reversed and instead just monitor the situation.  I had some reservations going into the block, but it seemed likely, however, I fully respect the review and would ask we all give the benefit of the doubt in this case.  I completely see why you reported it (I did block, after all), so there is no question as to your faith here.

"""  ::::Yes, there was no need for that at all. None at all.       In any case, the direct personal attack aside, there is no big deal there anyway - as my last edit shows. The way it was written with Claudius 25 made it seem like it referred to Claudius. But now, I just added three other scholars who say the same thing about the Orosius way. The real point is that for everything in that section stated by Slingerland there is """"a line of scholars"""" waiting to say otherwise. Slingerland is a minority view on these issues - every way you look at it.   That was why I asked the question """"Is Slingerland a minority view?"""" and requested a yes/no answer. All it would have taken was a """"no"""" answer with sources. But the """"no answer"""" never arrived. The situation is obvious, as the references I have recently added clearly show: Slingerland is singing a lonely tune.  The main issue was this: When the dates section (with 3 subsections) first showed up and I saw it, I noticed two things:  :* It quoted mostly one author in the entire 3 subsections. It may have had a couple of minor other refs, but it was mostly references by one author: Slingerland. And I knew he is not the only game in town.  :* And I could also see that the dates suggested were way off (I mean way off) because I had seen the dates the majority of scholars use.  The current references added clearly show that Slingerland is by and large a lonely voice (Doktor spin said elsewhere that Slingerland has the temerity to go against the scholarly  trend, or something like that) but temerity does not a majority view make.  The date section still relies far too heavily on the minority views of Slingerland and needs many more fixes.   """,0

"""Very clever, Creutzfeldt, though to first hold forth with strong opinions on something you quite evidently knew absolutely nothing about, and then, after a cursory skim, to blather your opinions for a lot longer, seems out of character for a supposed expert in """"mathematical logic"""" (a claim of yours I find very dubious), not to mention someone trained by """"the Jesuits"""" (I hope you're seeing a counselor). Moreover, you can't even apply your """"logic"""" consistently  Apparently, it seems quite reasonable for a 9/11 Conspiracies encyclopedia page to discuss, at length, claims about a remote-controlled rocket having hit the Pentagon, and other unlikely scenarios for which there is a complete """"absence of evidence,"""" than for this espionage puzzle, for which there is some evidence, and an interesting flurry of mainstream media attention, but not yet enough evidence for a firm judgement. It would be good someday to have a proper explanation about the """"Israeli art students"""" mystery, and not just your peremptory and prejudiced dismissal of it as """"fucking bollocks"""" (I guess the Jesuits trained you in that particular science).

I just thought that it was something interesting to consider in the 9/11 context, something requiring clarification, something that merits, at the least, a bit of consideration. It pisses me off, though, when know-it-all knuckleheads like you arrogate to themselves the right to decide the difference between heresy and blasphemy.

"VotingI don't want to see more mutual recrimination and circular argument, since clearly no consensus is going to be reached.

I want particularly to hear from Skyring whether he is willing to submit a policy resolution to go with the one I have written so that people can vote on the two positions.User:Adam Carr's proposal:I agree that the above list of statements on this issue does not constitute a vote, and I don't think Jtdrl claimed that it was a vote. Therefore we need to have a proper vote, decide on a position, and then enforce it. I therefore propose a vote (to be announced at the Australian Wikipedians Notice Board and conducted here). The vote should be between two policy positions, one written by Skyring and anyone who agrees with him, and the other written by those who disagree with him.My proposed policy position is this:That in Government of Australia, and in all other articles dealing with Australia's system of government, it should be stated that:1. Australia is a constitutional monarchy and a federal parliamentary democracy2. Australia's head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia3. Under the Constitution, almost all of the Queen's functions are delegated to and exercised by the Governor-General, as the Queen's representative.That any edit which states that (a) Australia is a republic, (b) the Governor-General is Australia's head of state, or (c) Australia has more than one head of state, will be reverted, and that such reversions should not be subject to the three-reversions rule.Edits which say that named and relevant persons (eg politicians, constitutional lawyers, judges) disagree with the above position, and which quote those persons at reasonable length, are acceptable, provided proper citation is provided and the three factual statements are not removed.Skyring should now provide a summary of his position of comparable length:And then we can conduct a vote.",0

"Vegan rebuttal Hello,I have been following this vegan debate and I have to point out a failure in your revision.You seem to be writing from a mainstream American or Western point.Most of the world does not shop at supermarkets - they shop in open markets - and specifically, the majority of vegan would go out of their way to support small independent grocery stores not chains.With regards to All cuisines, again, this is an important issue.You get your point for knowing Asian food but it is important from a vegan point of view to show that vegan diet is not something alien from another planet as one contributor wanted to add but something local and traditional to all nations and races.One does not need to list all nations ; Asian, Mediterranean, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Scottish, Italian, African, South American etc but yet they all have specific vegan dishes and ingredients which most metropolitan vegan sample.A modern vegan will tend to eat a far wider range of foods than a regular omnivore and the topic out reflect it.What is the specific benefit to writing supermarket or excluding all of the above apart to your ego?Likewise there are many other sources to buy such products - such as the internet - so it is utterly unnecessary.Let it be.22 November 2005",0

As for specific changes, I have looked again and think in the first section the last 3 paragraphs can be sorted out as follows:  Fish fulfill several criteria proposed by some scientists as indicating that non-human animals may experience pain. These criteria include a suitable nervous system and sensory receptors, opioid receptors and reduced responses to noxious stimuli when given analgesics and local anaesthetics, physiological changes to noxious stimuli, displaying protective motor reactions, exhibiting avoidance learning and making trade-offs between noxious stimulus avoidance and other motivational requirements. However, other scientists point out there are several neurobiological features in teleost fish and elasmobranchs that suggest they are unlikely to be capable of pain perception. Because of this, there is currently no scientific consensus on the topic, which remains controversial.  Pain in fish has societal implications including their suffering when exposed to pollutants, in commercial and sporting fisheries, aquaculture, in ornamental fish and for fish used in scientific research.  00:03, 26",0

"Question about guardian angelsAccording to the wiki article on demonology, there are 133,306,668 demons and the bible says1/3 of the angels fell from heaven and became demons.  Therefore, this would mean that thereare 266,613,336 good angels (i.e. 133,306,668 + 266,613,336 = 399,920,004 total good and badangels with the bad angels being 1/3 of 399,920,004)Given that there are about 6 billion people on the earth currently, this would mean thata guardian angel would have to have more than one person he/she/it is responsible for.I assume that God would not assign someone a demon to be his/her guardian angel, so thismakes the number of possible guardian angels at maximum, 266,613,336.  Since the worldpopulation is now 6,542,502,827 this would mean that each guardian angel would have tobe assigned 24 to 25 people.Does the above really sound reasonable to you guys?Also, what did those 266 million guardian angels do when there was less than 266 millionpeople on the earth? (The world population reached 266 million around the year 1000 or so)",0

"""DOUBLE STANDARDS & NOT BEING NEUTRALDear Wikinews, Wikipedia and """"WHOVILLE"""" since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers, including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted, and is grounds for action against a contributor, then please immediately provide documentation that editors, administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create, edit, supervise and/or contribute.  For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.Wikipedia and Wikinews editors don't follow Wikinews' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that wiki does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion.   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue.   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following Wikinews and wikipedia's own written polices, and such.Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest, not being neutral and such if they write or contribute.  It's against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete """"when in doubt don't delete"""" and not to show respect when communicating.  Yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control.  If you don’t abide by wikinews and wikipedia’s own written policies, then remove all of the polices and stop telling the public to follow standards which are double standards and more..  Does the owner of the company know you are doing stuff like this?  """"Whoville"""" and “Blackpearl14"""" do you, your friends and family or any contributors, editors, administrators or Mr. Wales or their friends and family own stock within the Walt Disney Company?  The Walt Disney Company page is not neutral, it is a series of promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Many of the other statements on the Walt Disney Company page don’t follow your so-called neutral definition.

"""few more issues that need to be addressed.  Perhaps interested editors could post new issues or try to fix them. Here is an initial list, put together in a peer review by Dana Boomer:Here are some concerns that I found in the article on a quick run-through: resolved Please make sure that the discussion regarding naming is completed and the decision is finalized with consensus one way or the other before you nominate for GA status. There are two citation banners in the article, both for lack of inline citations, and both were placed there several months ago. resolved There are several sections in the article (Working, utility and assistance dogs, Show and sport (competition) dogs, Dangerous substances) that are composed almost completely of lists.  MOS discourages lists in articles, so these should be turned into prose as much as possible. There are a lot of short sections in the article.  For as many of these as possible, please either expand them or combine them with other sections. resolved There shouldn't be external links in the body of the article as there are at the end of the Ancestry and history of domestication section.  Instead, these should be turned into references, moved to the external links section, or removed altogether. The article needs quite a bit more referencing.  For example, in the Ancestry and history of domestication section, six out of seven paragraphs are completely unreferenced. Make sure that all of your web references have publishers and last access dates.  Also, please make sure that you are actually using the publisher, and not the work.  For example, with current ref #41 (The Case for Tail Docking), the publisher should be Council of Docked Breeds, not cdb.org.   resolved References that are in English do not need to be marked as such.  References that are in any language other than English do need to be marked. resolved Current ref #70 (Wolf at my door) deadlinks. resolved The Australian National Kennel Club external link deadlinksI didn't go through the article line by line, so there are probably things that I missed.

These, however, are not original thoughts1. It is not original thought to check that a listed method of falsifiability falls under the definition of falsifiability. The definition of falsifiability is """"Falsifiability (or refutability) is the logical possibility that an assertion can be shown false by an observation or a physical experiment."""" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability.  A static fossil record is not an assertion that can be shown false by an observation or a physical experiment. The fact that the record is not static is a fact that tends to support evolution, but not a method for falsifiability.2. It is not an original thought that the idea of a deity is not allowed into science. Why would """"observations of organisms being created"""" be listed as a method of falsifiability for a scientific theory when they require a deity?3. The definition of falsifiability is """"Falsifiability (or refutability) is the logical possibility that an assertion can be shown false by an observation or a physical experiment."""" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability. If one of these """"true chimeras"""" were to be found, it could still be hypothesized that they were two individual species living in symbiosis and that they evolved into what you see.  Since an observation of this kind would not prove evolution false, it is not a method for falsifiability.4. """"A mechanism that would prevent mutations from accumulating"""" is not a method of falsifiability because http://books.google.com/books?id=JjLWYKqehRsC&pg;=PA157&lpg;=%20PA157&dq;=Drosophila+Fruit+fly+mutations&source;=web&ots;=%20V5yPPBPE6h&sig;=fOkUS_qLsARelWNDqpe5uhq70mI&hl;=en shows that death is a mechanism to at least temporarily stop mutations from accumulating for an entire population, yet evolution has not been deemed false.  Dave, you may be right. These may be original thoughts, but if they are, then the science backing evolution is in a pathetic state and founded by scientists not smart enough to look at the definition of falsifiability. Or more likely I cannot find peer-reviewed journal articles making my claim because there are no peer-reviewed journal articles stating that these or valid methods of falsifiability in the first place.

""" Coup not Revolution First off, I removed the reference to """"after Yanukovich fled the country"""".  The term """"fled"""" is loaded and POV.  To say he """"left"""" the country is non-POV... but the statement added zero value in the first place.  Second, let's talk about some English language usage for all the Ukrainians on here, specifically the difference between literal and figurative language:Revolution:  """"A fundamental change in power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time.""""Coup:  """"The sudden and illegal seizure of a government, usually instigated by a small group of the existing state establishment to depose the established government and replace it with a new ruling body, civil or military.""""Let me explain the difference clearly.  A revolution occurs when forces abolish government power structures.  This clearly did not occur.  A coup occurs when one faction of the government seizes control of the existing power structures.  This clearly did occur.There was no revolution in Ukraine.  There was only a coup.  This position is non-POV and sustainable.  I recommend:  """"Maidan Coup"""" or """"2014 Ukrainian Coup""""... but the term """"Ukrainian Revolution"""" is both POV and misleading.Note:  Above I use the literal definition of 'Revolution' to mean the violent overthrow of government power structures (e.g. the American Revolution).  Revolution also has a figurative definition of 'wide-ranging change' (e.g. the 'industrial revolution').  Applying a figurative term that is not literally true is necessarily POV.  For example, neither the """"Velvet Revolution"""" nor the """"Orange Revolution"""" were literal revolutions and their names are POV and misleading.  In both cases these monikers were coined by dissidents.  I recognize that these are the terms that are widely used to refer to these events and, having become widely recognized, are appropriate titles in Wikipedia.  That does not change the fact that they are POV.  Nor does it change the fact that, in this case, there is no widely recognized name for these events that would justify such POV naming.

"""Your not the only one speaking in a language of old....  From todays CounterPunch dotcom, On this the Seventeenth Day Of January, in the Year of Our Lord 2006.Bugging AmericaThe Liberties of the SubjectBy WERTHERThe overwhelming balance of recorded history has been marked by despotism. When homo sapiens sapiens transitioned from hunter gatherer to agriculturalist, he gained literacy, solid dwellings, and other accoutrements of what is commonly considered civilization. But he experienced a sharp decline in personal liberty.The reasons for this are commonsensical. Disputes between tribes of hunter gatherers could be resolved by one or the other simply pulling up stakes and relocating to a new territory, there being few material impedimenta to prevent them. A settled agricultural existence, on the other hand, implied permanent villages, granaries, and land boundaries to be defended against depredation. The need for defenses implied a national security state. Agricultural surpluses not only necessitated armed defense, but allowed a division of labor leading to policemen, soldiers, bureaucrats, and tax assessors, the latter of whom would confiscate a percentage of the harvest.The evolution of labor conditions also implied a different mental outlook. The hunter gatherer was an independent contractor (if not brigand) who ranged over extensive territory and worked alone or in small groups. The agricultural laborer, by contrast, toiled in one spot, making his comings and goings more subject to regulation.If the land was not his, he became dependent on the Big Man's favor. Given the increased population densities in regions where agricultural societies developed, he could only rarely strike out on his own: the good land had been already taken, and game animals cleared or hunted to local extinction. [1]With the rise of what Karl Wittfogel call """"hydraulic civilization,"""" [2] the screw of oppression turned once again against personal liberty. In order to build the extensive earthworks necessary for the state to survive the next drought or flood, the rulers of these proto-superpowers subjected their subjects to enforced toil and off-duty regimentation which rendered them no more free than so many draft animals.It is unlikely the rulers of the states in the Valley of Mexico, the Nile, the Euphrates, the Ganges, or the Yang-Tze had much toleration for the complaints their subjects, who were enslaved, enserfed, or otherwise regimented for the greater good as defined by the states' rulers. These complaints, had they been permitted, would have constituted freedom of speech.Nor would the rulers have given credence to a peasant's assertion that the interior of his crude dwelling, and the contents thereof, were inviolate from the inquisitiveness of the state. He, the peasant, simply had no rights a ruler was bound to respect (to paraphrase what a former Supreme Court Justice once said about slaves in a famous ruling in 1857); the only limit on a ruler's power over his subjects was the former's fear of rebellion should discontent overflow.Of the two rights discussed thus far, freedom of speech and freedom from arbitrary search and seizure, the latter is fundamentally more important to human beings' maintaining a status above that of mere hive animals. This is not intended in any way to disparage the desirability and necessity of free speech. But there are practical circumstances when free speech is not exercised by reasonable peopledue to reticence, shame, or its merely being not worth the effort. Or when one is married.Much obnoxious and exhibitionistic behavior is rationalized as free speech, while more urgent matters are suppressed: how many hourly employees feel free to say what they really think of their supervisors, and is the resultant lawsuit really covered by the First Amendment? But asinine reality TV blares on. Out of politeness or discretion, most intelligent people censor their opinions about politics, in-laws, bosses, and religion when they are in the public commons.The inviolability of one's person, and one's dwelling, is more basic. What would the average person resent more: being told he cannot ask questions of the President of the United States at a staged event, or being ordered to be strip searched in public? Or, for that matter, have his house ransacked? That is the principle at issue. The lesser freedom is essential for political discourse, the greater freedom distinguishes us from dogs. [3]Respect for privacy, for oneself and one's fellow citizens, is the benchmark of a sense of an individual self. The majority of psychologically well adjusted people believes that there are facts and circumstances about them that just do not bear the glaring searchlight of public revelation.

"""Hope the picture is clearer: This page (currently) focuses primarily on slave practices in Africa prior to the Islamic and Atlantic slave trades and then with a brief section on how those practices in Africa were transformed by the slave trades.  Connected to this page are Arab slave trade, Atlantic slave trade both of which are pretty good (although I prefer Islamic slave trade).  Less good are African slave trade and Slavery in modern Africa.  The first is an invention, there's no books about the """"African slave trade"""" (Davidson's book of that title is about the """"Atlantic Slave Trade"""") and probably a POV title. This is not to deny an """"indigenous"""" practice or trade in slaves for much of history; but simply that the focus on """"African slave trade"""" is prominent on wikipedia but not in the major books on the topic. Much of its content has long standing tags, some very problematic sources, and POV writing style.  The page could persist but only as a short exploration of the participation of Africans on inland trade of slaves and slave raiding.  The Slavery in modern Africa seems to have a good structure and some good portions, but needs some heft and a title change.  In terms of content overlap, there is some significant content overlap between """"African slave trade"""" with both """"Slavery in Africa"""" and """"Atlantic slave trade"""" (largely because African slave trade is a problematic title and because it analytically wandered).  Most of the other pages refer to each other, but content does not appear to overlap. Idea for reorganization (I'll expand this to more editors, but want to see if anyone has any ideas here first): 1. African slave trade page gets merged into """"Slavery in Africa"""" or other pages as appropriate. 2. Slavery in modern Africa gets changed name to Slavery in contemporary Africa, as more appropriate. 3. Slavery in Africa page largely eludes to slave trades without devoting significant section to the topic, that stays with the slave trade pages themselves. 4. A new article on """"Emancipation movements in Africa"""" or something needs to be created.

با عرض سلام خدمت اهل سنت و سنيان عزيز و گرامي در عراق و در کل جهان .ممکنه براتون جاي سئوال باشه چه چيز موجب شده که بيام و مجددا در حضور شما صحبت بکنم و موضوع صحبتم در چه خصوص است.اين صحبت من درواقع يه درخواست ازتون هست و درواقع ادامه صحبتي هست که در خصوص حل درگيري ها و ناملايمت ها که مسلما بين شما و شيعه وجود دارد.سنيان عزيز اگه يادتون باشه من در متن مباحثه قبلم در خصوص تشکيل يک سازمان واحد و يک حزب باهاتون صحبت کردم و نيز در خصوص عدم مخالفت هيچ کس و نيز کمک من به شما در خصوص تشکيل اين حزب گفتم درسته قبول دارم علت اصلي اين درگيري ها در گفتن زور به شماست و اعتقاد شما به قول خودشون ميخوان دين اسلام بشه يک دين واحد اما نمي دونن اصل دين در افتادن ياد انسان به خدا و فراموش نکردن خداست چيزي که  واقعا در دنياي امروز خيلي ضعيف شده فقط تنها چيزي که بر جاي مونده تنها لفظي هست که ما به ياد خدا هستيم چون نماز ميخونيم چون نيايش ميکنيم ما به ياد خدا هستيم چون مدام خدا رو نيايش ميکنيم اما در حضور خدا دست به هزاران جنايانت و اعمال ير انساني ميزنن مسلما در ان لحظه که دست به چنين اعمالي ميزنن خدا رو فراموش ميکنند يا اگه هم به ياد داشته باشن مسلما از خدا نمي ترسن و کسي که از خدا نترسد مسلما بهش اعتقاد ندارد چون هر اندازه که عقيده انسان نسبت به خدا قوي تر بشه بيشتر به هيبت و بزرگي خدا پي ميبرد مثل ديدن خورشيد از نزديک با ديد خورشيد از داخل يه سوراخ با فاصله هزاران متري هست مسلما زماني ميشه قدرت و شدت گرامي خورشيد رو ديد که از نزديک مشاهده اش کرد از نزديک حسش کرد و به همون اندازه که نزديک خورشيد ميشي از اشعهشديد خورشيد نمي توني طاقت بياري چون چشمان رو نابينا و پوست بدن را مي سوزاند اين همون حد انسان در مشاهده خداست به همون اندازه که انسان به هيبت خدا پي ببرد در محضرش هيچ گاه دست به اعمال غير انساني نميزند و اما چيزي که الان در دنياي امروز وجود دارد ديدن خورشيد از دال يه سوراخ در فاصله هزار متري هست خوب ببينيد خوب نگاه کنيد به جنگ ها  درگيري هاي ايجاد شده در عراق مسئولين کشور تحت عنوان قانوني به نام قانون اساسي دست به هزاران اعمال غير انساني ميزنند و با ادعاي اينکه داريم ديني واحد در عراق قرار ميديم و قانون اسلام رو پياده ميکنيم به مردم مخالف شون زور ميگن ايا کسي مي تونه به زور دين کسي رو تغيير بده؟ايا پيامبر به زور دين کسي رو تغيير داد پيامبر براي تغيير دين مردم و هدايت مردم باهاشون صحبت کرد از مخالفان ستم ديد اما باز باهاشون صحبت کرد اما عملکرد الان مسئولين کشور که ادعاي اسلام داري ميکنند زور هست به جاي اينکه اول با مخالفان صحبت ميکردن اين همه به مسئولين عراق گفتم در زمان فعاليتم قبل از سياست نوين اما هيچي به هيچي هنوزم که هنوزه تمام کاراشون از سر لج و لج بازي با من و گفته هام هست و من مطمئنم در اين لج و لج بازي مسئولين دولت ايران مقصرند اونم به دو دليل 1.به خاطر اينکه روابط رهبري ايران با مسئولين دولت عراق خيلي خوبه و2.اينکه چون من در مورد عملکرداشون که دارن با زور و شکنجه مخالفان نظم رو برقرار ميکنند و حکومتشونو به ثبت ميرسونن و يک قانون رو پياده ميکنند اونيکه که خودشون در نظر دارن و به زور اعتقاد مردمي رو که ممکنه هم عقيده اونا نباشن به دلايل در نظر گرفته خودشون تغيير ميدن در حاليکه خود مسئولين و حتي کسانيکه ادعاي دين داري اونم در دين شيعه رو ميکنند همچنان در دين اسلام و شيعه اش مفهوم شيعه رو متوجه نشدن و مفهوم اسلام رو.من نميخوام ادعا کنم که خودم دين دار خوبي هستم اما اينا که ادعاي کدخدا بودن ميکنند در دين داري اونقدر کامل نيستن در اسلام قانوني تحت عنوان اين نيست که ادما رو بدون تفکر در مورد خدا شناسي و انسان شناسي به زور به تبعيت از دين دعوت کنند اگه اين جور بود پيامبر حرکت اولشون رو براي دين داري مردم از اين روش استفاده ميکردن حتي در دين شيعه که من خودم مسلمان از نوع شيعه هستم هيچ امامي روش اول دعوتشون به اسلام و اسلام داري از زور نبوده با اينکه خيلي از مخالفان داشتن و با اينکه مدت زيادي از بنيانگذاري دين اسلام و اتمام مسئولين پيامبر در خصوص بنا نهادن اسلام گذشته بود خب اساس دين اسلام به دعوت نه جنگ هر دوره نسل جديد مياد با سئوال هاي جديد وقتي مسئولين به اصطلاح دين دار به زبان خودشون براي پاسخ گويي به سئوالات روش اولشونو براي براقراري نظم و نکنه اينکه حرفي زده بشه منافعشون به خطر بيوفته و منافعشونو در اولويت قرار بدن بنظرتون کار اونا روش درستي هست ممکنه بگيد اين روش درستي هست چون مخالفاني هست در اين ميان ممکنه از اين شيوه مسئولين کشور سو استفاده کنند و بيشتر مردم رو بکشن اما من ميگم اگه از روش اول استفاده کنن که کردن خودتون ببينيد هم مردم  دارن هر روز کشته ميشن و جونشون در خطر هست هم شماري از مخالفان و اعضاي مسئولين دولت دارن ميميرن پس اين نشون ميده روششون لنگ داره ولي اگه اول از روش صحبت استفاده کنند مسلما چون روش صحبت هست در بين مخالفان اونايي که سو استفاده گر هستن و اونايي که مخالف با دليل منطقي هستن کاملا مجزا ميشن و اين کمکي هست براي مسئولين دولت که بتونن ببين در بين مخالفان چه کساني واقعا مخالف هستن و چه کساني سو استفاده گرند در ثاني در اين روش ماندگار بيشتري براي تبعيت از قوانين حکومت هست و اتحاد اما زور باعث نمايش چهره بد مسئولسن در ذهن مردم ميشه که حتي اونايي هم که تابع مسئولين خواهند بود اگه وابسته به منافع و پول و قدرت نباشن به مرور زمان از عملکردهاي مسئولين سرد خواهند شد و کساني که حمايت از دولت ميکنند يا براي پورسانت خواهد بود يا براي چشم و هم چشمي خب اين نميشه اتحاد و مفهوم اصلي اتحاد اين نيست.براي برقراري اتحاد مسلما روش صحبت مناسب ترين روش هست و حال براي قراري نظم بعد از اينکه در صحبت بين افراد مخالف سو استفاده گران مشخص شدن براي سر به راه کردنشون از روش زور استفاده ميکنند و نيز استفاده از ر,0

Wikipedia has some rules, many of which were linked above, but because you don't appear to have checked them, I'll summarize some important ones for you:  *Always cite a source for any new information.  When adding this information to articles, use reference tags like this, containing the name of the source, the author, page number, publisher or web address (if applicable).  *""""Truth"""" is not the criteria for inclusion, verifiability is.  *We do not publish original thought nor original research.  We're not a blog, we're not here to promote any ideology.  *Wikipedia is not a general discussion forum, additions to talk pages should be about improving the article within the guidelines, not voicing one's opinion on the subject matter.  *Reliable sources typically include: articles from magazines or newspapers (particularly scholarly journals), or books by recognized authors (basically, books by respected publishers).  Online versions of these are usually accepted, provided they're held to the same standards.  User generated sources (like Wikipedia) are to be avoided.  Self-published sources should be avoided except for information by and about the subject that is not self-serving (for example, citing a company's website to establish something like year of establishment).  *Articles are to be written from a neutral point of view.  Wikipedia is not concerned with facts or opinions, it just summarizes reliable sources.

", 4 August 2010 (UTC)Stephan, may I borrow this comment and sprinkle it on my lawn to help it grow? Really. I have watched this topic area for years and BLPs of skeptics are absolutely littered with opinions like this. Do some research on skeptic BLPs and notice how much George Monbiot is quoted, and he's not even a scientist!. Editors like you have either ignored the use of such opinions as sources or outright endorsed it, because the opinions supported your POV. Now we have similar opinions from a respected climatologist, published in the Wall Street Journal, and all of a sudden it's a primary source?! Please! Anyone who spends more than 5 minutes examining the histories can see the blatant hypocrisy of your position. In fact, on BLP/N right now there is a debate about Michaels' criticism started by none other than ChrisO  this is the same editor who has, in the last week, edit-warred to include non-notable and weakly-sourced criticism in Chris Monckton's BLP.
