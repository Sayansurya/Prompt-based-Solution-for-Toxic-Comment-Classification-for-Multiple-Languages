"Hello!During The Dangerous Tour in 1993 Michael Jackson had planned to visit Mexico. The initial dates for the concerts in Mexico City were planned to be as following: 29/10/1993, 31/10/1993, 2/11/1993, 4/11/1993 and 6/11/1993. The first 2 concerts were done as planned.Now, Jackson had problems with his health and the last 3 concerts were postponed. The dates for the last three concerts were then set as following: 7/11/1993, 9/11/1993 and 11/11/1993.There were also some minor plans to take Jackson also to Monterrey after Mexico City dates, but these plans were then cancelled, because Jackson cancelled the whole tour on November 12 because of ill health.Now, please do not any more change the fourth Mexico City concert date! It was planned to take place on November 4, not November 3!! Please also read Lisa D.

I shall call them my Little Mexican Doggy Whoppers.So now you've changed your story of The Hours for the third time, eh? (Or is it fourth? Fifth? I seem to be losing count as you approach the limits of my pitifully deficient arithmetic.) If I, er, comprehend it correctly, the latest draft of The Hours has it that you originally """"thought"""" five hours was """"about"""" two hours. Interesting.  And revealing. In fact you sniffily dismissed the interval as """"less than 2 hours"""" (my emph.). Interesting and revealing because? Because the open-ended """"about"""" tends to support a story of an innocent """"estimate"""".  But """"less than"""" doesn't. """"Less than"""" is specifically limited. Narrowed in focus, specific, it's more clearly a calculated (no pun intended) lie. It's well-known that most liars have trouble remembering which lie they told. Less well-known is the fact that their use of words, trivial though words seem to them, often gives them away. Freudian slips? Elementary, my dear Watson. By the way there's a good book by Adventures In The Screen Trade author and screenwriter Bill Goldman called, I think, Which Lie Did I Tell? It's about Hollywood. Are you a Hollywood pooch? Sporting a diamond collar from Harry Winston and peeking out of a B-list celebrity's purse?

"""Take Swift Stern Action against this guyHi Sue,Long time. How are you?I visit wikipedia only occasionally these days.I just came across this: I think you should give Crossmr a stern warning of NPA and CIVIL on his talk page and I think you should remove that despicable PA and uncivil comment(check out the heading/edit of the comment /edit summary /etc.) from royaa's talk page. Or let me know if I should personally give him that warning and remove that despicable comment myself. I would be happy to do that. Thanks.It seems that Crossmr is acting with a malicious instigative agenda. He keeps rambling on about old things and keeps repeating himself (and his instigations) about them. It seems that he is unable to move on, and let peace reign, and is hung up on old already-settled bloated issues, not to mention non-issues. He seems to want to live in the past.And to think that this guy goes around placing warnings of CIVIL and NPA on other user's talk pages. Talk about missing the plank for the speck. Tsk tsk. LOL. He should pay attention to his own Block Log  and history!!!!! lol.He also needs to learn properly about AGF and pipe down.His ill-intended comments are obviously malicious and deliberately provocative. But instead of me being provoked, he only serves to amuse me. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. But it has to be made clear to him that his uncivil rants are totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated. I think coming from an admin will make him, a general user, understand better.Thanks and regards. ) PS. If first time newbie issues like first time misinformed """"vandalism"""" are brought up, especially from their IPs, almost everyone on wiki would be """"old vandals"""" because almost no one is expected to know wiki rules when they start editing on a whim via google one fine day.

Though I think I had already mentioned it on one of the accounts user pages and also the edit histories and everything else is so very obvious!

(Talk | Contribs) Test WikiJust confirming, I am user Steve Crossin on Test Wiki.   24 character articleOk, so I did a quick format of the article, and started searching online for interviews with the actress. I have come up dry thus far, and was wondering if you have found anything.   Specifically what article were you referring to? And, an admin has said I can use material from the 24 magazine.    I was looking for those interviews, but I couldn't find them. I was trying to help with the Karen Hayes article.   Ahh, the article on Miss Hayes P Hehe, I have a fair bit of info on her, and I can also now abuse the use of {{cite episode}}. A citation is a citation. Also, I know it hardly ever happens with TV shows, but what rating do you think the Nadia Yassir article would receive? That is, after the injunction is lifted.   Definitely B, lots of references but needs to be more expansive for GA status and beyond. Once you gear up to do that, you could always post the references for Hayes that you find on her talk page, that way I could help out )   Hehe, I could do that..and I think I will also work on trying to get Nadia Yassir to GA status. But my real goal? Getting Jack Bauer to featured article status. It would look quite good on an RFA. I'm gettng admin coaching. And also, I prefer bullets, so don't mind if I realign your comments on my talk page P   That's fine, and good use of an old school laughing face, I love those.

""" regarding International humanitarian law The protection of hospitals is according to the Geneva convention.

But: Even if enemy combatants are inappropriately using the facility for shelter, the """"rule of proportionality"""" usually forbids such attacks because of the high potential for civilian casualties.

And that is not a choice.Why having qualifiers, as if the Geneva convention is not clear on the point of the protection of a hospital.

""" and sounding similar to the English word nigger are used without the disparaging connotation the word holds in English. The French cognate , however, commonly used during the colonial period, is similarly considered offensive, whereas  (literally, """"black"""") is the standard word, with the Anglicism black being a common slang term.Interestingly, in some places these words refer to people with an only slightly darker appearance than those native to Northern Europe, i.e. people who might be said to have a typically Mediterranean, Southern European/Eastern European appearance without any facial or hair-texture characteristics associated with black people. There are also socio-economic reasons behind this as southern Europeans but particularly eastern Europeans are stereotypically deemed more backwards and less well off than their northern European cousins.Forms ultimately derived from Latin  have been borrowed into various non-Romance languages, and may be used to refer to people without negative connotation; The Hungarian  referred to black Africans without any negative connotations until the 1990s when its meaning changed under English influence. In Latvian, """"nēģeris"""" is still referred to black Africans without any derogatory meaning. The word nigger, typically with the same spelling and more or less similar pronunciation, also appears as a loanword in languages other than English and has the same racist connotations as the English word. In Nazi propaganda, the German compound niggerjazz was used as a derogatory term for jazz music, which Nazi ideology held was a degenerate form of music. In Yiddish, """"shvartzer"""", meaning 'black' is considered offensive while """"neger"""" is the standard word.Non-human usesIn the past, nigger was sometimes used as a synonym for """"defect"""", deriving from the phrase """"nigger in the woodpile"""", which originally referred to escaping slaves hiding among woodpiles being transported on trains. It came to mean some unseen problem.Definition of nigger in the woodpile For example, the May 1886 issue of Scientific American, page 308 said, """"The consequence of neglect might be that what the workmen call ‘a nigger’ would get into the armature, and burn it so as to destroy its service.""""The term nigger was used in lumber mills until the mid-point of the 20th century. It refers to a device that turns a log while it is being stripped of its bark. This may be an off-hand reference to the prejudicial use of the word, as until the machine was invented, this was considered a job too dangerous for anyone other than a black man.Literary usesNigger has a long history of controversy in literature. Carl Van Vechten, a white photographer and writer famous as a supporter of the Harlem Renaissance, provoked debate and some protest from the African American community by titling his 1926 novel Nigger Heaven. The controversy centered on the use of the word in the title and fueled the sales of the hit novel. Of the controversy, Langston Hughes wrote:The poem Little Topsy's SongLittle Topsy's Song: Sung by the Hutchinson family A modern recording. Music by Asa B. Hutchinson(1823–1884), Boston: Oliver Ditson, 1853Little Topsy's Song: Text and Sources Music by Asa Hutchinson and also by Henry Russell (1801–1900) written in about 1845 by Eliza Cook has the first stanza'Topsy neber was born, / Neber had a moder; / Specks I growed a nigger brat, / Just like any oder.The famous controversy over Mark Twain's novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), a classic frequently taught in American schools, revolves largely around the novel's 215 uses of the word, often referring to Jim, Huck's raft mate.{{cite web| title= Adventures",0

"""  Two more things then.  I see you revised the Archive, but placed the material below your and Jehochman's final comments, in fact beyond the whole """"discussion bottom"""".  Note, some/many of the comments now cut off were made while the section was titled """"Resolution""""; I inserted the """"wikihounding"""" label at some later time and then continued commenting within that (and maybe there were others' comments too, i am not now checking).  The current archive presentation suggests incorrectly that you and Jehochman did not see / were not aware of that discussion.  By the way, in Edit view of the Archive, I can see that there is a hidden comment """"original location of wikihounding/false proposals sections"""", at the location where they were.  I think the item should be restored to that point, or it confuses matters unnecessarily.    Second, I don't happen to like it being collapsed, either.  Collapsing is suited to stopping discussion, which is what you wanted, okay, because you view it offtrack from the AN proposal.  But it does not need to be collapsed in the archive, because it is less readable and cannot be pointed to directly.  The archiving of the whole discussion accomplishes the ending of discussion already.  Is it your judgment, or whose, that the discussion should be collapsed within the archive?  I think it was your judgment or someone's that the stray, non-archived portion left behind by MizraBot should be closed, but that is not the same as your judging the material needs to be collapsed in the archive.  (Or was it consciously collapsed by someone before MizraBot archived the rest?  I currently think it was just an accident that MizraBot didn't archive it all together, but please let me know / show diff if you or someone actually collapsed it first.)  So, besides your moving it to the right location, I also think it should be uncollapsed, as it is clearly closed but it needs to be referenced and readable within future discussions.  If you would see your way to doing that, too, i'd appreciate it.  But if you do not agree to do that, on this second point, I would just like to be able to know it is your personal judgment (or whose) that it must be hidden (why?) and to point to that.  It would be simplest of all in future discussions if it could just be pointed to.  (It was all together and MizraBot messed up, right?  This is not my fault nor anyone else's.)  Anyhow, please implement the move to the correct location, and I will accept your judgment either way, but hope you could state why, on the second point of uncollapsing.  I am guessing that I should not make these edits myself, but I want to know who is responsible for it being hidden, if someone is deeming that it must be hidden.  I don't think there is anything terrible there that must be hidden.  If you think it must be hidden, please say so.  Maybe also i am overestimating the difficulties that will be caused in the future, but it seems better to be able to provide a wikilink to a specific section in an archive, which I think is now not possible with it collapsed.

"(UTC)Every second year the Falcon is going to be replaced. It's a difficult situation because Ford Motor Company Australia is the last Australian designed and manufactured company that isn't working on the base chassis and running gear that FoMoCo USA is putting out. Truth be told, the Ford Falcon is the ONLY remaining Australian car (which I didn't see mentioned in the article, I'll address this in a sub thread).However, OP is correct. The EA and EA 30th anniversary model and mk ii were possibly one of the most reliable of Ford Falcon's releases, the fuckers used to push up to 600,000 on the odo before engine parts started to fail. Many taxi used variants rolled the clock over, I remember seeing a mates hit the big 0's on all original parts, and owned a 30th as my first car.That being said, the Taurus would never compete, it's too expensive and too shit. FoMoCo AU left the EF in the microwave a bit too long and it resulted in AU's. Some of those were washed with cold water and shrunk into what they termed the Taurus. 211.30.150.155  00:49, 9 December 2011",0

"One could allow 3 conventions  1) a parallelogram is never a trapezoid  2) rectangles are trapezoids but not other paralleograms are  3) all parallelograms are trapezoids  I am fairly sure that almost every current US textbook uses convention 1). So that should maybe be noted to avoid confusing students (hence I would revert the latest change). I personally think 2) makes sense since the main theorem becomes (parallel bases + equal base angles)<=>(parallel bases + equal legs)<=>isosceles trapezoid. Also then every quadrilateral in the trapezoid rule is a trapezoid! Since b-a=0 in this case, some of the formulas (with (b-a)^2 in a denominator) need a fix (cancel out the (b-a)^2 from the numerator). (gentlemath at a public computer)",0

""" Rayleigh scattering There is a """"citation needed"""" at the claim that Rayleigh scattering can be seen. I just did some research on Rayleigh scattering in air; I added some content to Rayleigh scattering. The bottom line is that at atmospheric pressure, Rayleigh scattering at 532 nm is about 10^-5 per meter. A 1 mW green laser has a luminous power of 0.6 lumen, and hence rayleigh scattering is 6e-6 lumen per meter over a 2 mm beam (a 0.002 m2 surface). The beam will hence appear roughly as if it were illuminated at 6e-6/0.002 = 3 millilux, which is comparable to a moonless clear night sky. (I should actually correct the number to deal with the angular distribution). A dark-adapted eye should be able to see this, especially when you look along the beam, which multiplies the apparent brightness by 1/sin(theta) where theta=0 deg means you look paralell to the beam.Now I'm not sure how to turn this original research into verifiable encyclopedic content.

":::Who said that royalty, politicians , bankers and merchants were logical? Money is a commodity not a measure. It's worth what people think it's worth. Distance, temperature and volume can be defined by standards. 'Weight' is dependent on gravity, but as we spend most of our time on the surface of this planet the 'mass' measurement will suffice as a standard. How can you have a standard that is fixed and never-changing for money? The nearest I can think of in terms of money measurement is the Mars Bar standard sometimes used here in the UK. But even that fails as relative prices of other products have changed differently. PCs were around £1000 to £3000 at one time. The one I'm using here cost £110 - new earlier this year. Mars Bars have increased in price... The only standard for money is to arbitrarily take one commodity and use that. Gold, silver, copper, cattle, cowrie shells, iron, all these have been tried. Iron rusts. Cowrie shells can be imported from their beaches. Cattle can be bred - and can also die of disease. Copper is common and easily smelted. Gold and silver had the advantage of being relatively useless, distinctly pretty, and fairly corrosion-free - and there wasn't much of them around. The Spanish imports of gold from the New World did very nasty things to their domestic economy and that of the rest of Europe too. Gold was a practical standard once. When it was rare. But, when you give up carting gold around and switch to using bits of paper representing gold, you are reaching the faith test. Do you believe that the Blankshire Bank has the gold in its cellars? If you don't know, you have to depend on reputation. Read Terry Pratchett's book 'Making Money'. Very funny, but with a lot underneath the comedy. (You may need to read 'Going Postal' first, but maybe not. They're all well worth reading anyway.) I won't give the plot away, but it is very relevant to this discussion.",0

By 1929, driving on on the left while having a land border with a country that drove on the right became impractical, so that's why Gibraltar change on 16 June of that year.  HistoryDo we have any reliable evidence about the historic foundations of LHD/RHD are?

However, i have never been able to find any evidence of this.   -Please do excuse me for sounding a bit daft, but I'm not sure I understand the question. Isn't that what the entire article is about? In addition, I think the problems ascertaining the specific history are quite well-presented.   SwedenUnder Safety factors it says""""Research in 1969 by J. J. Leeming showed countries driving on the left have a lower collision rate than countries driving on the right. This research is questioned in Peter Kincaid's book on the rule of the road,[citation needed] but some countries that have switched to driving on the right, such as Sweden, have seen their long-term accident rates increase by more than any increase in traffic volume[citation needed]."""" The red part is totally made up, and the opposite is the truth. The number of accidents was cut in half from the first day of right hand driving, and has not increased substantually since then. Swedish right hand driver 83.255.35.43  H'm. This what you're saying doesn't quite make sense, either. The number of crashes will surely have gone up since 1967. Perhaps you mean the crash rate (per vehicle-kilometre travelled, per thousand vehicles registered, etc.) has declined, which would make sense since that's what's been happening in just about every first-world country over the last four decades. Nevertheless, the assertion you call attention to is unsupported, has been for quite some time, and at the very least is questionable.

"""   :Yes, I am sure G.Khan existed. We have many sources for that, from friends and enemies, although I doubt he was a member of the CP. Jesus, as well, is referred to outside of the Bible by contemporary Roman sources, who would not be biased toward making the guy up. But that aside, you and I aren't going to see eye to eye on much of theissues raised, so let's just stop arguing about it.   I still believe your list is fraught with problems and offer two quick illustrations:   *Walter Bernstein is listed as one with a """"covert relationship"""" with the USSR, yet this is based solely on one Venona cable that has """"Khan"""" stating Bernstein would file a report when he """"returns from his trip,"""" which involved a journey into German held Yugoslavia for an interview with Tito he was doing for Yank magazine (Hardly a left magazine of any sort). The identity of """"Khan"""" remains unknown (not Ghengis), Bernsteing does not even have a codename,the relationship between the two remains unknown, and neither the FBI or the NSA identify Bernstein as an agent of any kind. So, aside from K&H;'s assertion, on what basis would you include his name? This is just one example of K&H; slandering a man simply because his name is mentioned.   *Donald Hiss is another, and although his name does not appear in Venona, your intro to the names makes it appear that it does. The sole accusations against Hiss rest with Chambers, and later, one mention by a fellow named Rushmore, which never led anywhere. The FBI files on Donald run from 1942 to 1957, He was extensively investigated on all aspects of the charges (you can check this yourself by going to FBI.gov and clicking on the FOIA tab). The investigation was first closed in 1952 with the FBI referring to Chambers' allegations as """"unsubstantiated"""" and stating that there had been """"no allegations of espionage at any time."""" The case was then reopened for a perjury investigation as Donald had testfied under oath that he had not been any time a member of the Party, or any affiliated group, in any way, shape or form, nor had he ever known Chambers at any time. That investigation extended over the next several years and not one of the FBI's party source had ever heard of D. Hiss, other than from coverage of his brother's trial. Donald was never charged with perjury, nor is there any indication in the published files that the FBI thought he should be.  He was then investgated again concerning resurfaced charges Chambers had made concerning the first Harry Bridges deportation case. Again, the allegation led nowhere. The link to his name lists him as a member of the Ware group, but the FBI could not substantiate that. Lee Pressman (another name that should be removed, but later on that), who testified willingly, stated that he had been in the Ware group and the party for about a year and a half during the period cited by Chambers, and that neither Hiss brother was involved as far as he knew. Nathanial Weyl testfied as well that Donald was not a member. So, again, why is his name listed, other than K&H;'s assertion which appears to be based solely on Chambers'assertion, which the FBI calls """"unsubstantiated""""? As for suggesting different language for the names, that's fine with me, I'll try to come up with something later, its kinda late now.Grif     """,0

"Glosbe does translate ezman as “heaven” (******) or “sky” (*****) and it back-translates “heaven” as ezman. Some definitions from Merriam-Webster Unabridged: Heaven. 1. a. … especially, the expanse [of space] that seems to be over the earth like a great … dome — usually used in plural. 2. a. … the place … of the blessed dead. Earth. 1. a.  … soil, ground. 2. the sphere of mortal life comprising the world with its lands and seas as distinguished from spheres of spirit life — compare heaven, hell. Sky. 1. b. the expanse [of space] appearing as a great vault … over the earth. 2. heaven (def. 2) — often used in plural. Tremble. 1. to shake involuntarily (as with fear, cold, excitement, fatigue). These two expressions are good idiomatic English: “If his wrath is aroused, the skies will tremble [in fear].” “If his wrath is aroused, the heavens will tremble [in fear].” Here the singular “sky” and “heaven” would not be used in good spoken English, only in mediocre written English. So we have a choice of eight ‘very good’ literal translations: “YPG is [goes] walking, and the earth and [the] skies tremble.” “YPG is [goes] walking, and the earth and [the] heavens tremble.” If you try speaking them aloud, you may find that this one sounds best: A. “YPG goes walking, and the earth and heavens tremble.” Something about the meter (the cadence) just makes it sound liks a military motto. The present-progressive clause “YPG is walking” would naturally correlate with the present-progressive clause “the earth and skies are trembling.” But we want to use simple present tense in the second clause.  (See above.) To do so, a native English speaker would begin with “YPG goes walking …”, because it combines both tenses: simple present and present progressive.

Could you please help me with this? Thanks!  ==The hope==  Hi Monni3. I uploaded the image successfully, But in my discussion, I'm classified under the molecular biology project while I'm under the Ufchem project. I don't know if I can correct this.  Thanks  ==clarification from idevera==  Perhaps I was misunderstood about what page I'm going to edit. I'm not editing the Second Messenger Systems page but the Lipid Signaling page at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_signaling.  When I clicked the link in the Articles and Members section of our Biomembranes wiki page, I was surprised to know that I was assigned to edit a different page.  The article on Second Messenger Systems is a very broad topic since it encompasses basically all types of second messengers.  Whereas the page I'm proposing to edit is more focused on lipid signaling, with a section on second messenger lipidsthe same topic I presented in class.        ==question from gfanucci==  OK, to chat with you and ask questions, is this the correct format to use? I ask because I am not quite sure how to respond to Matt's question as he didn't make a page for himself, if I leave something in response, do I just click on his talk page link and write back? Will he see it?  thanks for this help, I hope that we can pull this off and have something respectable by the end of the semester!    ALso, I can't seem to find the page you set up for the course. There is nothing on the UF Biomembranes page that is linked from my user page...and I am traveling, so I don't have my notes with me...help? Only one student has put something on my talk page. I hope they start moving on this. Oh, when you answer questions on my talk page, how do you know things are posted there? are you constantly watching it? SHould I respond on that page or on your page?    * So, it appears that some bots are going around after students are editing and uploading figs. I have noticed some problems with figure liscencing, so if I find something that looks OK, but a bot says it is not OK, I will contact you; as I think you will pay attention to my notices more than the students will! smile. Can you check out the Lipid signaling page discussion to see if the problem with the figure was addressed?       ==",0

"""::::::::: Use or indeed overuse of the words 'informer' or 'suspected informer' alone remains pejorative and inappropriate here. Angus's suggestion of """"suspected by the IRA of being an informer' is not unreasonable as it indicates that it is a concept or crime particular to that side of the dispute. Sarah argues, """"What they are commonly called is what we should reflect here. Any inhabitant of Ireland who assisted with information given to the British was an informer."""" She avoids my earlier point. 'Commonly' has to include, in Ireland, Protestants and Unionists (who were themselves British) and therefore the concept is not common currency unless you regard Protestants as people of no consequence at all in the matter. Can you inform yourself?And was it in 'common' use in Ireland that you would call someone who had reported a rape or a stray cow an informer? Sarah's other point that """"Protestants who openly supported the Republic were never killed. So it wasn't a sectarian matter"""" is risible. As if you execute those who come across to your side? Anyway most Protestant Republicans became Catholics.

Make the diffaculty REALISTIC.  2. start the game up and wait at the Equiptment boxes for your freind to arive to the game. your both going to have to get assault rifles with a 6x Scope.   doesnt matter which ones i used the AK-47 and G36A4. Choice is yours. and get full nades but """"DONT THROW FRAGS YOU WILL NEED THEM""""  3. Now your going to have to do a little killing first. so exit the room and there is a open area to your right you will have to clear out.   Do that then proceed through the doors. now your inside clear out this building and proceed up the stairs until your outside ounce again.  now your almost there clear out the open area in front of that building then proceed inside and clear it out.  4. Now ounce your inside the building (This is the part where you have to you have to send your team to diffuse the bomb)  first kill the two guards by the bomb and then YOU and FREIND go stand by the bomb. then tell FREIND to stand dirctly behind the bomb  and look up at the turret on the catwalk (above the door you entered) now order your team to disarm the bomb ounce u do that throw a frag grenade  at the door directly behind the bomb you should get 2 kills. NOW IT HAS BEGUN.  now your probably thinking damn that is alot of shit. BUT it isnt that above takes 10 minutes MAX if your not garbage.   So just follow those steps and then pick up here.  Now ounce you have thrown the nade there is going to be 1 guy that constantly respawns by that turret on the catwalk. Soon as u kill him  he will keep popping up forever. but the trick is that ur FREIND cannot move.   he has to stay by the bomb at all times (if he moves it will get defused and the mission caries on so STAY BY THE BOMB). now YOU move up closer so   you can spawn kill him (like halo2 modding spawn kill LOL) just hold the trigger down where his head will pup up. i prefer you put your gun on SINGLE SHOT  becasue thats 31 bullets = 310 points. (in 10 seconds HaHa). now ounce u reload that where your freind comes in while your reloading he covers your ass   that is his only role until you run out of ammo then you switch and cover him with your pistol. now ounce both of you run out of ammo   START>RELOAD CHECKPOINT (this puts you back in front of this room with your ammo refilled) so you can do it all over again.  also it will get laggy because the FRAME RATE on Rainbow is 30fps. so when your reloading run over to the bomb (like hump it) move around next to it   this make the bodies up top disappear and it wont lag until your next clip is done. THATS IT Just keep repeating until your done...   YOU ARE ON YOUR WAY TO ELITE NOW! Just so you know i did this for a about 3 Hours 2 days in a Row and im now a ELITE.

"""  == Army (Soviet Army) ==  Hi Buckshot06,  I removed the request for the cite. I should have just brought it up here, and I don't care for the way that asking for a cite places an article into the """"unsourced statements"""" category, as if the article is asserting that unicorns have just taken power in Tanna Tuva. Sorry about that.  On the topic of the article, I think it is very valid.  The comments on the talk page miss the mark because army and corps structure, in WWII at least, were considerably different among the combatants, and considerably so when one considers the military organization of the USSR. A comparison of various high field command organizations might be a good topic for Wiki.  On this topic, one idea I've had for a while now is that the often-used comparison of a Soviet army to a western (or German) corps is at best tenuous.  There may be similarity in terms of manpower totals, but from what I can tell, the Soviet army seems to have the bulk of its troops in combat formations while a western corps has the bulk of its troops in the logistical """"tail"""". I'd be interested in your thoughts on this.  I was glad to see your article mention the return of the rifle corps as a command echelon, as many comment that the Red Army abandoned the use of rifle corps in 1941 and never re-instituted them.  I have to dig into the Soviet OOB someday and see precisely when they re-emerge, and I also suspect the armies not engaged against the Germans kept their rifle corps HQ throughout the war.

""" Edits with a seemingly personal agenda Dear Sir:Recently you have made misleading edits that constitute vandalism on the """"Barlas"""" page on Wikipedia. To the ethnicity of the Barlas as being Turko-Mongol you added """"Persianized"""" - this is a general and ambiguous term and there is no way to verify such an assertion - you then footnoted it with a book on the Persians but never really provided the exact quote you are relying upon - first, I would ask you do that, and second, even if you can provide the exact quote from the book on the Persians, I suggest you examine the validity of such an assertion. Barlas is a world wide clan that was originally Mongol and then was Turkicized through intermarriage with Turks - Iran was one of many countries ruled by this clan and to use this simple fact to assert they were """"Persianized"""" seems inappropriate and misleading and an attempt at trying to reduce the authenticity of the facts on this page.Also, how can you change """"Central Asia"""" to """"Greater Persia"""" when Central Asia is what exists in fact and """"Greater Persia"""" is just a concept or a term of reference and does not exist in fact?I have seen your previous edits and it seems your efforts to change the ethnicity and culture of the Barlas clan are aimed at a personal agenda to contend, perhaps due to your religious inclinations, as has been unsuccessfully tried before, that the Barlas were associated with Persia. Sir, your words cannot change the truth and I would ask you refrain from playing with such things for personal motives. If you persist with trying to dilute the quality of this article with misleading assertions, I will notify Wikipedia and ask them to ban you.""",0

"""Kingpin, thank you, I think that would be appropriate.  (talk) Responses:I have made no """"legal threat"""" to anyone. It is a matter of an apparent breach  of a moral obligation by Sven Manguard to me. I worked hard with Wikimedia Australia over a three-month period to develop an idea in great detail, which is complex and has many original elements. I conveyed some of the details to Manguard after he assured me he had no intention of developing anything remotely similar. I was then told by a third party that """"Sven grabbed me on IRC to tell me he is planning a similar project"""" and that Sven had said """"well, I'm going ahead with it"""". Manguard has since said on my talk page, """"you missed your chance, your partnership fell through, and if there is even the slightest chance of it coming to fruition, it's not going to be for several more months. I'm not going to drop my efforts, and I'm not going to wait indefinitely for something that at this point I'm pretty sure is never going to happen ..."""". Actually, the partnering institution had already agreed in principle, and there has simply been a delay in implementation. I have been led to believe that others in the WMF have been apprised of the idea; but I'm in the dark as to what level of detail he has divulged, and whether clearly identifiable details of my scheme have been or will be duplicated without attribution. If distinctive and original details are being conveyed contrary to his undertaking to me, it is a moral breach; and if they are implemented without attribution to me, that is also a moral breach; if this occurs, I believe I have a moral right to inform people of it. This is the gist of what I said to Manguard, but now I'm been accused of making """"legal threats""""; this is based on a complete misunderstanding. In fact, I don't have a legal foot to stand on in that respect, and he knows it. Why is this being construed as anything """"legal""""? For all we know, Manguard's ideas might be quite different; but he needs to communicate them as a courtesy as much as a practicality.I was the person who suggested publicly that Manguard and Adam be """"directors"""" at FSC, only a few weeks ago. I believe Manguard has done good work there, so I don't understand why this spin-out is happening. It has quickly morphed into accusations of """"gross incivility, threats of off-wiki harassment, and personal attacks"""". I see no evidence of gross incivility by me (aside from an unkind thing I said on his talk page yesterday—""""not mature enough""""—which I'm willing to withdraw), nor of personal attacks. Instead, I have endured major and repeated personal attacks on his and my talk pages. No one has mentioned those.This seems to have been mixed up with complaints about my reviewing at FSC: they are surely two different issues. If people are troubled by professional reviews of soundfiles, I think there's a big problem for features sounds. I have presented factual evidence and what I believe are balanced opinions, and have supported a few WP-produced files, too. I encourage WPians to present their own performances for FS promotion, just as our photographers do at FSC, but please let's review them professionally without fear or favour.  (talk) """,0

""" Stub sorting guidelines I sincerely believe that we really need to lay down the law in stub sorting, and really provide a guideline.  I believe that we should all attempt to reach a general consensus by April 2, 2005 in a set of rules that we can follow.  Once we have built a set of guidelines, we can formally create a policy out of those guidelines.  We need to define what a specialized topic stub is, how many articles it should cover, when is it appropriate to create it, what defines its need for its creation, what defines its need for deletion, what criteria it should follow, what are the general steps should one take when sorting a stub, whether or not to start using subst: for all templates, whether or not use subst: for all templates created by the meta-templates, and any other matters that may come up in consideration.  I thank  for initially creating the subpage for the project at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  Even though they have been discussed, I feel that we really need to confirm everything.  For that, we should discuss each issue with its own sections, and raise a list of issues that we need to nail down before really continuing on.  The English Wikipedia is nearly at 500k articles.  Either the MediaWiki software needs to handle stubs such that they can be found with a simple union of categories, or the sorting is done manually by Wikipedians.  Personally, I think the latter is less taxing on the server load, especially when we use subst:, which I think would help the Wikipedia out, performance wise.  Please make your comments at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  I apologize for making this somewhat of a spam notice, but since the project has more members, the project can finally decide on these important issues at hand.  (talk) 23:23, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)That thing you did‘’Hi Gadfium - a while back I was having trouble with some geography stubs, and (via the Village Pump) you found out for me that they'd been created twice, and fixed them. What did you do?’’Just delete and restore the article which is appearing more than once. If that doesn't seem to work, try refreshing the category that they're in (edit the category page and then change the URL to say refresh instead of edit), and as a last resort, make a trivial change to the duplicated article to force a change to the database.  01:47, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC) changing geo-stub this is bordering on the absurd.  I have ended a number of my articles and stubs with Oceania-geo-stub, and someone has changed them to just plain stubs, so now I make it just a stub, and someone comes in behind me and changes it first to a geo-stub and then to an Oceania-geo-stub.  07:09, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)Nuthin' to do with me - and anyone involved in the Stub sorting project should know to leave it as a oceania-geo-stub. Which articles do you mean? |hello? I don't even know precisely which articles they are anymore...most of my recent edits have had to do with the islands of French Polynesia and the Cook Islands.  I haven't bothered to look at who's changing the stubs, or if perhaps it's a problem with the db (I've had on occasion to submit several times...)   07:46, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)The db may be the culprit. These stubs are very heavily used and the system does seem to slow down a bit with them. Not sure why that would result in the multile template changes though. As to an overhaul of the names, that would mean changing 50+ different regional stubs which between them are used on close to 10,000 articles. It's simply not practical. |hello? Ah.  I will look into it.  Tokelau has always been something of a side-bar interest for me, since they seem to be the """"left-out"""" islands.

"""No, they certainly do not have a copyright on the flags. They cannot stop anyone producing a very, very close imitation of their drawings. But following the blazon—emblazon argumentation, they may have a copyright on their particular rendering of a flag, even if the flag/blazon is PD. I think the issue is similar to maps: the geodata is PD as bare facts (well, for the time being at least), but a particular map drawn from that geodata is copyrighted. We may draw our own maps, but we cannot copy someone else's copyrighted map.Besides, I take the liberty to not support either side here. As I wrote above; I did not tackle the issue until now, and I don't feel I know enough about the issue to give an opinion with confidence. I just think that it is well possible that they do have a copyright on their images.Except maybe in the case of very simple designs (three differently colored stripes, for instance) where indeed a """"no originality"""" claim might be valid. But for more complex flags, that argument breaks down. AFAIK, identical blazons have been rendered quite differently throughout history, e.g. with animals shown in a more """"classical"""" or a more """"modern"""" style. Take for instance Image:Kent Flag.gif. The blazon is """"Gules a Horse forcene Argent"""". Now look at the COA shown there, at our flag, and at the renderings on the website of the Kent County Council... I think they all comply with that blazon, but are all different and IMO show enough creativity and originality to be individual copyrightable works.  """,0
